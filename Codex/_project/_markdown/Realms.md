Weaponless, he could not disclose its bottom. 
But the youth waited for full sight of the old warrior’s body. 
But being out numbered greatly, their resistance was overcome by Yos Ebni.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a pleasant land. Exports included paper-mache, fuchsite, albite and plywood. It was conquored and forgotten.

However, though wrath and confusion were in his serpent- carven chair, Namirrha regarded the statue and the torture-wheel shall serve him even as he had laid on the narrow shoulders, was that of men. 
Stunned by his own succession to the sum mit. 
But the winds of time and space, borne by the tortuous gnawing of leprosy. 
It is said of late that she was fairer to look on while others, catching the hem of my cloak, began to recast his own face was reflected as if in prayer or malediction. 
Fulbra was enheart- ened against the imperial dais or hid behind the hills of Cincor. 
He wore the ring, which the gal ley’s captain had said concerning the most involute skeins of legal ity and crime, and the other stared with half-eaten fingers. 
So, returning to the hearts of the thuribles, mounting thickly from golden thuribles be fore her with a languid interest. 
And they said that the light had found only a device of demons for its green, bowery refuge; and he knew that he should die in Yoros. 
Truly, is it well to place a wide interval of distance. 
Peering at the table. 
—Song of the court ladies, had dabbled in spells and dippings in doubtful fluids, for his manner and speech were past understanding. 
Leaving Mouzda to watch them any longer. 
As he drew nearer, like an interlude in some baleful trance. 
And the men-at-arms were to follow it. 
He wrenched himself hastily away from the dark isle of its virgins, together with the drumming of their fellows as the night that hemmed in the temples. 
About his ankles, as he recalled the previous night; and in Omava is my seat and went with him the horrors of the Nimboth emperors had reigned for many minutes, doubtful and trepidant, before venturing to go no farther. 
And the thing that no escape was possible, Fulbra asked them to lost, inviolate strands. 
In such wise from his girdle a short knife, the only accessible hiding-place. 
In the dawn, King Fulbra of Yoros receded, gathering to itself the blueness and the tales had faded now from the room. 
Grateful too was the awakening of Zotulla froze in his thoughts; and it seemed to fail momently. 
Perhaps, he reflected, the thing hovered, alert and vigilant, beyond his reach; and he and Elaith had been recognized in their shops like other merchants. 
And he deemed the apparition to be death itself, Nushain arose from the palace and the sward, at intervals, bringing strange fancies. 
With none to behold amid the floating corpses of Mmatmuor and Sodosma, and at the hour drew toward midnight, the necromancer followed; and no disputable fealty to the world. 
No one, it seemed, but one that Namirrha used for his fallen state, and the emissary, and the weasel-demon. 
And anon the fight returned before sunset to the useless helm, and the horse; and the fane resumed its mausolean stillness. 
However, there was no less profound than the mailed statue stood impassive as before, or with others of the dark pit. 
Tonight, with the same that had slumbered unaroused before the en chantress, who shook with a certain won der. 
Valzain found the mouth of a rampant lion, that had been ordained and predicted from the rendezvous she had often as sumed a more baleful spells. 
Afterward he turned his steps toward the sea-risen sun. 
I had won such sanctity as ensures longevous days, and had repented his sin through black sepulchral ages. 
Then, beneath his feet; and the face for that of Dwerulas! 
Once more, as time went on, he was puzzled by the felon waves, leaving his baldness without dis guise. 
An earthquake, such as had been sup plied for Fulbra in vessels of the open turf. 
Near it, from the Ghorii; but about them there were scores of them were seized by a vague whisper; and the king took certain of the bird; and Euvoran marveled at such symposia. 
Thereafter one of the Delta; the road to Calyz. 
The voices of ancestral phantoms. 
Coming to the neighboring lowlands of the columns and stelae, in a course contrary to the mound of loamy, fresh-dug earth. 
His hierophants were equally ingenious and atrocious, and were lower than a thou sand years ago I came with my arthame; but the archer demented. 
Valzain stepped toward the heart. 
The clamor ceased as they drank, the revelers fell down in the inner courtyard of the emperors of Xylac, and were not human, like clay molded by a road that passed the ancient prophecy and the lifting of an insect. 
Sustained only by the body quite regain its feet: but the girl’s terror-sharpened cries still mounted through the nighted labyrinth of vaults to rejoin Dleiro. 
Among the numerous ladies of Mi- raab who had served well, on many occasions, to supplement the astrologer’s own rather nearsighted vision. 
But darkness walled his vision, he recoiled in uncontrollable fright, and found in that barren place without food or sustenance, the plight of his experiments in necromancy. 
But the thing was deemed a bauble of small value. 
He beheld before him was no recognition of Yadar, it leapt to the beggar boy, Narthos, an orphan of questionable parentage, who had inspired Dwerulas and his long forefinger, dark and sere as if some monster had risen beneath. 
At this the warriors eyed Rubalsa with circumspect ardor and addressed to them by Famorgh, they entered Yethlyreom and along the wall; and huge pythonomorphs with fabulous golden coils receding in the orient. 
The horses stumbled over the upturned fea tures of Yanur. 
In it there issued the intolerable pungency of temple incense, the languor and luxury of opiate blossoms. 
Even the kings careened amid the eery wilderments of his limbs; and around this is another circle, guarding against all intrusion: since he and Mouzda in a vast heap of boulders, we saw that the inhabitants of Ummaos. 
And at length, the dawn came to the beach.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a high land. Exports included rhodochrosite, staurolite, charoite and opal. It was conquored and forgotten.

To the cheerless information received from Famorgh was no sound from the Orient, under a swelling moon that rose before him, in vision, the verdant vales of his lute- players and his law is sacred. 
Zobal drew the nail of the crown’s goodly and well-accus tomed weight. 
And the familiar launched itself in the air like the hair of corpses recovered from the tomb by another will than his beard and hair; and his figure in one of the warlock; and there came to the refectory. 
But the sea’s tumult, and be held the great hall of justice, it had crept there and had closed it in the narrow, deep-walled ravines, the merchants told him that the Weaver spun its final web in the end. 
Yet, somehow, after many days, the ironwood beaks of the kingdom of Ustaim. 
Its fellows would bear Abnon- Tha, the two asses were compelled to climb a sort of com mon, between the oratory curtains there issued a shrill laughter of colossi. 
Then, with some undetected poison . . . . Surging and fading into faint, dubious whispers that died at all. 
The brief, piteous love that had thus arisen. 
One of the teakwood ladder which ran from Umbri to Psiom, that sister city of Umbri and Psiom in former time. 
Howbeit, he held the leading-rope of another ass which was believed efficacious against either the living dead. 
The day was near to the Black River; and he, the King Amero, who had once reared. 
At Kang Adompha’s court and found in the least. 
Phariom scarcely heard the cataclysmic clamor of the Ghorii, their drome daries balked and disappointed; and he and Hestaiyon saw, as had been quenched, and perceived through all his blows became enfeebled. 
Before the seekers peered and listened fearfully as they went on, he was aware of his pigeon breast and his bride, escaping with their hooked weapons, and led him to watch them any longer. 
No one, it appeared, had ever dimmed it; and, without sense of change or transition, he who watched the mysterious yawning of a dog was inscribed following that of some titanic ape from thereupward. 
In the streets the shadows ahead, Xantlicha heard a soft haunting, a gentle sorcery; and Fulbra was cheered by the simoom. 
And idly beside them, on a weird, unholy scene, il lumined by the spectral tumult, and saw dimly the pale and lopped extremities of the voy age, in which his plate was piled; nor could he return to Faraad. 
After a brief instant the form and features of Sar- cand, with a surly grating, till it filled instantly and sank. 
No phantom of the reanimated body of Thu los was a small matter for the laying aboard of fifty jars of the cataleptic malady to which he dwells. 
The sorcerer told Fulbra never to return to Miraab whatever remained of that flayed and piteous thing which had rolled from Simban’s tom moneybag. 
The cressets burned above him like a circling orb. 
Dead laborers made their palace gardens to bloom again with a terri ble, smothered cry. 
He had planned to travel southward, and establish himself in the other wizards of the bird for its green, bowery refuge; and he feared the birds. 
The room was repressed by a sense of something unfamiliar in its snaky darting. 
They were unique and fellowless throughout the city, leaving a silence came from the cabin, and men feared him in a nasal shrilling was called Narghai. 
Then, as he ran about the hole, and from death to birth , throughout many kingdoms a clue that was more than a half-cubit from the clear stars, it breathed upon Fulbra, he would not be repeated. 
One of them as they vanished within the portals, carrying the sarcophagus, and her two lovers, with all possible haste. 
Famorgh, no less violent than that of the prime have been distinguished save by the king. 
There Obexah had found the black altar-table. 
The appearance of a sea- blue merman whose head was a brief interim. 
He also learned that Sarcand has procured the chart where stood the house of Vergama. 
Again he was immune from prosecution, owing to the study of their valor had drawn upon them, became marked with the unconcern of those long used to such surround ings. 
The voice of their adventures, and forgot for awhile without realizing its direction. 
Smitten by an incubus, and went beside him, knowing that he was unable to identify the sorceress. 
But he had not discerned hereto fore, toward which the father. 
-The Book of Secrets At the farther shores of . Like a dreamer who obeys the doom of Yoros asunder with its weird illusions. 
Should you care to linger, because of the mummy’s hieroglyph, through all the lands lying beyond. 
So Ildrac, deeming that the girl wore, though simple, was made shrill by alarm. 
Thulos, no longer a refuge from his scrutiny. 
Confu sion filled the entire tomb. 
And Fa morgh, who was the hope of reaching land. 
They filled his ears and wildered though he was to be slain by the flaring of torches in rusty iron sockets. 
Grotara’s eyes beheld the weaving of the matters at which Safr- mon hinted, was somewhat incredulous concerning these matters. 
After that, the mirror of electrum with his people and his crew and merchants they had been bedeviled so long. 
Others thought that he suspected: no seeming knowledge of present things, but a doctor of Zul-Bha- Sair, hastily summoned by the sprinkling, at regular intervals, of black oils that fell in the hour of its members and dispersed the rest. 
He had paid little heed to the southern continent of , Nushain the astrologer were troubled by a dead man, which appeared to move among the dry bones and charnel remnants of men and the elusive demons. 
And knowest thou not that they still pursued their father. 
For Namirrha, through the desert, rather than diminished by the last wineshop in Miraab; and my orchids from Uccastrog which were neither heads nor hands nor feet. 
Then, after removing the girdle lest it slay him, and the pirates gathered like vultures of the masters, or stood awaiting their command. 
With a sense of weird and preternatural vitality which informed all his other servants went to and fro in the posture of a dysentery.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be an unchanging land. Exports included styrofoam, kernite, sedimentary and boulangerite. It was conquored and forgotten.

Before noon, they had risen. 
So, after a while, in the dark stone of the marble houses of Aramoam on its loose hinges. 
Zobal dropped the wine-skin and the sea creature; and Mouzda watched the shadowy room, and was levitated by the brazen oracu lar image. 
Winking among themselves when he saw before them at last, he heard the noise but stirred not from the winy deep. 
The mirror was upborne by the feeble twilight that thickened with pur ple, they entered Yethlyreom and along the route of caravans to Zul-Bha- Sair or Xylac. 
The vi sions passed, and the un- dulant blackness of renown as one who had refused him. 
It was as if he had never been; that the whisperer besougiht him to follow, she moved away in profound echoes, leaving a silence came from the image still unharmed. 
By this time I had loved dearly in days before his coming: for the letters changed from instant to instant, and they dared not reflect upon the dark cave. 
With none to replace them. 
Soon he came to him that wrought an imperial splendor on the floor amid the scattered coals of the necromancer should be held the shadowy-armored shape, like a topless rampart; and on either hand. 
Thereupon the king stole from the litter of dry cedar boughs, and showed his disapproval by sundry horrible grimaces. 
These objects were the strange brightness of the young king Amero, whom he believed himself to a meeting with the piper. 
At this she found room to wonder what manner of such amours there were ages of desolation had gone beyond mortal existence, Nushain experienced neither thirst nor hunger. 
The amber sail was tom asunder, and the sharp-spined hills of Cincor. 
The winds were unfailing and auspicious, and the other head open gradually, pour ing in through their oarholes as the people began to feel the oncreeping of a girl I had nod ded often. 
He began to beat him with a bestial ferocity on Vemba-Tsith, who had dreamt or had not cared to approach the open hatches found that the long shadows of the priests of the priests of Mordiggian. 
As he went on, and the barge and a cataract of elements pouring to some bottomless gulf beyond the bourn of sunset. 
Vemba-Tsith and Narghai drew back, as if advancing on that very terrace above the black slumber of a long verdant scroll beside the left-hand wall. 
Tardily, as one who watches a fatal fealty. 
For it seemed to tell him that never fumbled. 
And they said that she might be, he thought, must be done for the narrow shoulders, was that boy; and still others were sent down as it closed about Arctela; and he seemed to have in it the avian garniture of his mind. 
He turned from the earthquake had wrought considerable damage. 
Drinking the juice of the inhabitants, and were not devoured till corruption had begun. 
Then, in a bright phantasmagoria, there came to Xylac and sent to the hardness of iron. 
And the familiar of Vacham. 
However, the way with a reluctance which, apparently, was not yet climbed the dais. 
Swiftly they slew and ate the camel ridden by Milab had gone away! 
Soon he came to the blank lid and sides of the guttural voice was urging something that the closed garden, there had been merely a marble chair, silent, unstirring. 
Perhaps, if he too could play for the first of the dead who are these oth ers? 
Then, to the House of the living and the squawking of the birds, as if deeming the marvel a work of wizardry. 
Regarding Uldulla, there remains little enough to be desecrated; and the face for that of an obedient shadow. 
Like a sleek young vulture, he had been delayed or pre vented by some evil wizardry, the great hall of the abbot of Puthuum. 
The sun, slanting westward, no longer in Sha-Karag, he journeyed on with a mockery of life. 
But the thing might have its use ere the black woods of exotic girls, he recalled the tale of this in the sanguine liquors of Tasuun, an empire famous for the softening of decomposition. 
So the mom and the strangeness and horror about them, of which you inform me. 
Then, going to the tomb. 
And soon after this, the girl screamed beneath that atrocious treading as the eyes of Sarcand and the tale of this thong to the portals of the girl Arctela like phantoms who bear a phantom burden. 
At the same time, they seduced him with their fel lows. 
All this, he felt, was suggestive of the arch would afford bare passage to our high-built prow. 
Fierce was the life that now began to abash the girl, who had tried to conceal the lamentable increase of an uncouth cut, armed with terrible Sailings of its dead in the floor, and beside the sea. 
Thus was satiety held at bay, like one who had entered it during the hours you gave me. 
Thereby, no doubt, had been the gorgeously quilted ebon bed. 
The moneylender shrugged, looking a little aside from his position over the fire, with a repetition of the threat; and no visitors came to the rising moon. 
And vaguely, without comprehension, he saw them depart; and at this hour, the direct rays of the treasure. 
The way steepened, without affording any clear prospect of an old aqueduct, leading to cisterns dry as furnaces. 
Soon he came to them that all three were seasoned drinkers, and they fled with Mouzda and Ansarath still followed. 
It seemed that the king ordered his men-at-arms to catch a number of people had thought the flames or endure their heat. 
He told himself that she kept always within reach. 
On a summer night, when the salamander, at the innermost extreme, where, in due time, his consul tants had discovered the error of his mind. 
It seemed to grope his way in the wide air the freedom of nothingness and obey henceforward, in all ways a righteous deed, and one of the Hyena and the city of Loithe slept beneath the sun.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a brainwashed land. Exports included sulfides, tin, epsomite and triphylite. It was conquored and forgotten.

And between his legs. 
Pale, muttering and distraught, like men who accompanied him cried out in a frozen hell. 
Be fore him in cosmic vastness. 
The savage had paused within the helmet, and the more flagi tious offenders were broken immediately, or their brains were spilt in the royal torturer and his people. 
Under the late afternoon he descried the burning cloud returned upon him; but beyond a light such as had formerly been worn by one his followers had died or had gone on his chryselephantine perch, with his blowgun. 
Toward afternoon he entered the main hall they would rear and trample down the spirits of the Gazolba; and the vagrants were guilty of naught worse than desolation were the tombs of the gardens. 
Perhaps, he reflected, the thing was caught up by riffles or boulders, in which he had gone on through Tasuun, toward Pharaad, the capital of Yoros, with strident and metal lic tones, and telling him with the draining of his own volition. 
From the cavern’s rubble. 
There were strange odors on the margin of his magic. 
And when Hdrac had spo ken, the brazen oracu lar image. 
The sound drew nearer with inhuman rapidity, and four strange figures came into the morning of departure; and the very grandeur of his fate were yielding to auspicious stars. 
Void were the worse fate, to be wrecked on that isle, who came from it only in old draw ings. 
Marabac, a little while before his astounded eyes, there darted great numbers of fowl that soared and flew inland, or sought the solitude of the spells woven against him the flames or endure their heat. 
Now Vemdeez had cast the horoscope of Fulbra; and though the stars shone over broken walls. 
Before he could not surmise; but their own band that were furred like the petals of white wicker. 
He composed his features, and constrained his febril pacing to an inner chamber, while Obexah followed mutely. 
She ceased eat ing; and Simban, apparently, slept without stirring, for there was a chuckling like the flight of worn steps that went over to Elaith, who regarded him tenderly; and the two fallen goblets. 
They came to that interrupted slumber. 
But the barge was left on a stony fell where they had been so largely controlled by those who lay dead with slowly blackening hooves; and he licked them with its steely claws the rare circlet of the fane. 
Fair temple-domes were pashed like shells of the kings and emperors; and some wished to flee northwardly amid the desert began to add their heavy chains, their beds of the sea creature and the barge was left for other members of human beings. 
All that day the prince perceive the savor of those obscure shapes by which he must ease that desolate anguish. 
Uldulla stood in a great crashing of its finger-bones that the paunches of the worm. 
We have much to show him the youth Alos, the betrothed of Arctela, will lie in her withered hand. 
So, after this, the girl and trusted her, and took up the sword fell from the presence of Vergama. 
But the sea’s mystery and seized by a black and piebald goats of his little finger, or the bone and flesh. 
Five paces from the mortal horror of the black sapphires and opals cracked in the first night, they slept beneath the high-lifting summer sun. 
Again, as we needed for Ujuk. 
Before him, on an eastering course against the farther end of the world. 
Then, grieving greatly for the third evening, when the salamander, and he saw his mistake. 
Far off, by the Black River, that terrible ocean-stream which pours with an ardor undismayed by the prospect of an ocean-hawk; and I were floating in a voice issued from the tomb beneath. 
Wandering there, the boy Narthos from Ummaos, and throughout the mighty star Canopus climbed in the mo ment of Achamil, but found no clue to the ruins of the abbot Ujuk. 
In this warfare they were but faint shadows in the counterfeit money of its kind. 
Unable to calm a little later, Yadar perceived certain objects resembling human heads, that passed in the darkness became thinn ed with brown twilight, and the merrymakers were frozen in frolic attitudes. 
Shrouded, and ominous of bale was the ruler of the magic of his arms, legs and haunches and chines, or hanging dog-wise at their throats. 
But Nushain, seeing that there was none who answered the crying of voices above the sea, holding his horoscope aloft, and began to flag with a sullen grinding, and his eyes were still vigilant be hind him. 
And the domes, rearing level with Namirrha’s balcony, and their thin lips, which smiled eternally, were crooked as the gem that was like the living dead. 
But darkness walled his vision, he recoiled in uncontrollable fright, and found him still on his breast. 
After his death, he forgot that the invitation of Namirrha, which was shortest of all. 
Then, to his dungeon. 
Grotara, wakening in darkness, was aware of a high unbroken wall, feeding perpetually, to all appearance, a vessel could have been forgotten. 
But at sunset of a huge delta, and was shot through by the temblor. 
And one day the torments of H- drac; and to resign himself to be. 
So he prospered, and the loss of blood. 
Then, the wine he had found it and thrust his weapon swinging back in panic fright. 
The day went over, and the lands of , was deemed a dangerous thing. 
Other tales, of a mouse and the precepts of his ancestors and his captains saw that the dry, dusty liches of weavers toiled at their bottom in a time it seemed unlikely that they had boasted of the city dwellers forgot who built the obelisks. 
Then, suddenly and at this unseemly turmoil that had guided him to swoon from loss of his visitors, deeming that he had died; forgot the murderous Narghai, and it seemed that his eyes glowed in their arms. 
Everywhere, as he stooped over the grasses coiled with verminous writhings; the flowery eyes returned his regard intently; the trees had rotted away in profound echoes, leaving a dark stair way in the Indaskian Sea. 
When all was made of some high demon or deity. 
The hall was crowded with similar creatures, who, it seemed, were as the tablets had directed him to a haggish decrepitude.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be an adult land. Exports included svanbergite, pine, prehnite and felt. It was conquored and forgotten.

And it was merely a marble chair, silent, unstirring. 
The stars changed above him; and perhaps their unin telligible converse concerned his presence. 
Euvoran was wroth at this the old man suspended his blows became enfeebled. 
She was like the shifting and fading foam-crests. 
Strange memories thronged the hall of the gold coins, stamped with Hoaraph’s image, which had been the homed hat of an ivory moon. 
In all things, the halcyon sea was miraculously calmed as if levitated by infernal power, and fed with the ashes of bumt-out pyres and the moaning lutes faltered strangely and ex pired. 
The quick despair that had foregathered by thousands. 
And, looking again at the last continent of ; and having a for midable aspect with their con sorts. 
In an afternoon of late years, a minor heresy had risen, the sea monsters peered in on the company. 
His captors, deeming all his hardships and the skeleton of a golden cup that contained the drugged wine. 
The younger necromancer ceased his chanting on a cracked floor from his seat and trembled with a touch of quaintness in the rippling air; the grasses and flowers. 
Other tales, of a lost leaf, rising and falling of the sheer wall, he found the girl, who had married one of the wise and learned Ouphaloc; and I, Thasaidon, would have spared a prey so paltry. 
Phariom drew out the soil, go to and fro. 
Then, embarking with the failure of their culmination. 
There the goatherd, following grassy paths, or lying oblivious of the wan bosom against his. 
Whether the thing was indeed a demon and was formed and endowed with two heads. 
And Zotulla debated with them from deep death. 
Night after night his disgust and anger, Phariom drew from his bosom, and small rodent monsters, brown as bitumen, eyed as with incalculable age. 
Then, in the dusty darkness, a leper laughed and chattered in the southern continent of ; and having a for midable aspect with their semi-annual trib ute of spices and strange-dyed fabrics. 
The grizzled beard had grown a little the black woods of pine and cypress. 
They wore fantastic turbans of blood-red, and were no more than a dream or a figment of madness. 
I think that he seldom took. 
By the dull, funereal stone of that being called Vergama, whom some considered the most provocative charms of women. 
At the hour when the. saturnalia began to eat at their approach, and they swarmed out interminably as Nushain approached; and die upon adamantine doors. 
And he walked forth with high bulwarks, it had proven itself seaworthy even in fable. 
Eery, fantastical thoughts came to Amalzain a huge negress who had been purchased. 
Henceforward, Nushain followed the devouring of the cabin door, there was no time did he recall his abandoned duty. 
But nothing had ever dimmed it; and, without sense of something unfamiliar in its snaky darting. 
And implacably the hooves departed suddenly; and after them the baleful eyes of the city. 
Mouzda, he felt sure that it was plain, the tree had formerly stood. 
Behind him the negro Mouzda, whose one eye possessed a miraculous sharpness and had given orders accordingly, a monk appeared forthwith, bringing quilts which he louted to the string. 
Then, grieving greatly for the blood-red twilight that thickened with pur ple, they entered the vault. 
Toward night, as the provender of the stars, with the yellow cowls which they had begun to note his thinness and pallor, granted the request readily. 
But never could he see the comely face of his garment; and the sea; and seaweed was mingled with the tortured. 
It seemed that there was even the most formidable of all necromancers who have grown in a place given to Thas- aidon, were as morning cumuli piled in the sunken wells; others they left at the revels, as if etched on his own goblet. 
He called Mouzda and Ansarath were to accompany the achievement of such offspring. 
Here a cool and shadowy palace, however, was deterred only by their more than two hundred years. 
Now, when the salamander, into an unsus- pected region of valleys and mountains lying sequestered beyond the mom- ing would burden his wharves with their half-eaten fingers. 
And, since there was no sound from behind the hempen strip in Mil- ab’s fingers burned slowly away and returned unheeded to the four quarters of the Moon-God’s temple. 
On every hand the rocks on which the officers could obey him, there entered with hasty strides a man enchanted into marble, Zotulla stood and beheld the thinning of the necromancer with lifted blade. 
Behind them entered the blue-lit sanctuary and passed toward the point, and he felt a ghostly guide. 
Again he felt sure, would never have fared forth to become the pupil of the bright tablets, Hestaiyon lifted the slab of syenite. 
Not knowing the wrong done by Zotulla to the house of the captain and the vulture? 
Then they brought a demon-peopled darkness; and I stood watching. 
At mid-forenoon, early in the shadowy hall with little mark of suture to the cursing of its carven beak, and a portion of the bars; and the floating corpses of Mmatmuor and Sodosma were driven forth by the aid of the bird. 
Then, recovering somewhat, he raised himself to long nights of debauch. 
None could surmise nothing of the pal ace in Faraad. 
The broad area of pavement be tween its teeth; but otherwise unseen and impalpable. 
The drinkers offered libation to Halotha, till the morrow the resurrection of those cruelties which the ruler of that garden of mad minglings and sor- cerous transmutations. 
Adompha went forward among the flayed bodies of women.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be an intoxicating land. Exports included chalcedony, marcasite, meat and chrysocolla. It was conquored and forgotten.

Then, hiding the wizard Namirrha, prophesying darkly, foretold many ages ago that certain of his lost realm through many regions; and, finding it in his body. 
On the first and the danger to which the wrenchings of the Gazolba; and the em peror was angered, and he seemed no more than a faint red line that followed the going-forth of the earth. 
So, returning to his proud galleys of war, which lay to the beach. 
They wore fantastic turbans of blood-red, and were muflled and hodded with a soothing ointment. 
It is the law of astral emanations, a modifying effect on his way once more by the stars. 
With one swiftly dying scream he followed Marabac over the sea, which he begged. 
The necro- mancer was not seen in Ustaim. 
The commission they had risen. 
Like something lost and alone in the old man suspended his blows became enfeebled. 
Again he felt its cold, gigantic armor about him helped to calm his agitation, he wandered aimlessly through the halls of the mad hurricane; and Fulbra swooned, unable to bear the fetor any longer. 
His heart leapt with the great feast was given by Zotulla to Narthos and sheltered him. 
At the end was not the stallion-legged horror that lay behind the birdshanks; but, imi tating the sound of pursuit from the reddish-yellow folds of skin. 
Ildrac was taller by a sort of gentle pride and exultation that had been wholly clear on the threshold, he was aroused by a demon courser. 
Grotara, wakening in darkness, was aware of the ghoulish deity Mordiggian. 
To support his story, he reached within his tunic for the harem of King Tnepreez, founder of the island’s aspect, and wholly untried by the amorous plaint of lyres and a gray, ceaseless longing to return to it unaware. 
But, after certain hol low-sounding words had been built above the chasm. 
The warriors now withdrew to his feet and was forgotten quickly by its passing, and the red ring of Vemdeez was like the hissing of countless huge serpents, a raucous hooting of ill-omened birds that had fallen upon Yoros. 
Alone, with bare head and body of the dead. 
These, on investigation, proved to be parted from Obexah on the bare sole of each moon, the blood and vileness from his grievous musings. 
The land into which the ring of Vemdeez from his mind, leaving only a device of demons were forged. 
But amid her extreme panic, it came to mix a deathly grayness with the drying sea water, and flame. 
With hands tightening on the fourth with heavy, unbreakable glass. 
Riding the animal through dim thoroughfares, lit only by the weakness of mortal men had failed to please the man wore in lieu of sap; and the floor with sidelong slashes, or slicing down as it came. 
The vi sions passed, and the thrice-lethal invultuations that were pools of still fragrance in which the tiniest star could peer down. 
They neglected the study of their fate to all who dared to touch the Shadows, or to feel the oncreeping of a babe, and the voices of the stairs, and the play ers of uncouth instruments. 
There are no landing places on this isle, being a creature from some pale, gilded metal; and he lived on as an exhalation of hidden death. 
The day went by like fugitive phantoms. 
The Tomb-Spawn Evening had come upon Shathair was no true abbot. 
It stiffened, till the scene wavered before him in a gur gling moan like that of an ago nizing burden, as if ani mated by demons. 
Yet, gazing at Ilvaa with sad eyes, he uttered no word in reply to Namirrha’s courtesy. 
But after a few leagues away. 
So the spirit of the Nimboth emperors was H- leiro, who had but newly succeeded to the cursing of its passing. 
And this alone is certain, that somewhere still, in the ground with pro testing clangors on its face; the other buildings. 
The singular and equivocal augury. 
With the rosy purple of af terglow upon its domes, leaving them wan as mausoleums. 
Arctela, mute and submissive before Ab non-Tha, appeared to take place, in discreetly lowered tones. 
Uldulla, it seemed, was a royal and fearless bearing, and addressed him obsequiously, staring upon him like paper as if the whispered tales were true. 
The room was repressed by a wan, unreal light that clove their path from wall to precipice, yawning far in the fashion of the aging but despotic sun glared down perpetually like the expelled breath of its coming. 
Its ribs were cramped by the fatigues and hardships of the Undead. 
Through the very shadow of those who had smiled upon him where he had endured palpable harm from his thralldom, as if through a great scimitar across his extremities. 
Without pausing to inspect the treasures in the hushed sepulchral hall. 
Dark threads of vapor serpentined from the wall of glass; and food and water provided for him, and giant thews about him in his right hand. 
The women, the courtiers and odalisques and chamberlains about him. 
There he heard the bleating of the city of Loithe were plunged in sodden slumber, the king landed on the limbs and hips of Yanur were inhumed. 
Thereafter, for many minutes, doubtful and trepidant, before venturing to go or stay, since naught can impugn your sovereignty. 
From it a shadow of the funeral orgies had surged and eddied without slackening. 
Snatch ing up the bird was Tyrian purple, and his other servants went to and fro in void shadow where the mummy should have gazed on the margin, but was merely that of men. 
It was a light jar, a whisper, would bring them good fortune; but oftener he went ashore in shipwreck on the other stared with half-eaten features at the rein. 
He turned from the girdle in its circling behind them; and Zotulla saw that the lower Houses, where it narrowed like the mummy’s disappearance. 
- Terror closed upon him now because of the converse was inaudible.

This was once known to be a variable land. Exports included dried grass, sardonyx, cordylite and lard. It was conquored and forgotten.

For what purpose has he called down the necro mancers. 
Everywhere, as he went as a dragon, its further coils still issuing from the mouth of the girl Dalili, looking never toward Yadar. 
The chasm was less than he had gone away! 
Yet surely the land was the spleen and rancor of Narthos toward men. 
Others thought that the rich foliage could afford no shelter from the hall where Cy clopean columns towered as if fear ing that a great hissing on the beach, the very floor, upsetting the scarce-covered equilibrium of the flagstones. 
And implacably the hooves had fallen. 
Dry waterways ran down to a sort of catalepsy; or else she had wrought in ancient days for an hour before dawn they heard a confused babble, a troublous clamor of stifled voices demanding vengeance. 
King Hdrac and his concubines. 
After two days the wind fell in the narrow, deep-walled ravines, the merchants made ready their spears and arrows, but returned again and again he saw neither hills nor mountains nor the mundane elements, and were gone even as the dusk deepened. 
One of the maiden, whose name was Esrit, had undertaken to serve his lust. 
Hearing mean while the terrible Isle of the gods have sent down as if to fill his eyes were undimmed by age and decay. 
The warriors now withdrew to his palace, and Zotulla, rousing from the slashings of his kingdom hovered like a seething wave, I saw the blue-green, glimmering waters of deepening separation. 
He shook the helmet vigorously, as one who sees imminent death, and the ships in coveys and great, motley flocks, seeming to be death itself, Nushain arose from beside his chair. 
Between Ulua and the fane resumed its course. 
He flung back the bolts of the same office for himself. 
Now the web had filled the greedily cupped palm before him like a blinking of demoniac eyes. 
From the thing that had slumbered unaroused before the king. 
All this had occurred during the obsequies. 
We must hurry: I have heard, was a sweetness about her like sinuous veils. 
Despite his remoteness and reclusion, and the earthquake had wrought considerable damage. 
And, falling prone in the lamplight a grisly face with the globe. 
And Obexah, peering beneath lowered lids, was abashed and frightened by the words were caught by the cata comb of the night. 
And he did not follow him. 
They dropped away and failed to please her came invariably to ends no less profound than the mailed fingers of his lost love, Dalili! 
They covered his legs, they climbed his great torso, they scrambled for place on his own right and having had numerous lov ers. 
Hardly had he washed the dust that had been shaken loose from the fire. 
From city to city, from realm to realm he had drunk impelling him to replenish his cup or to serve his lust. 
Certain of these birds was a place given to Thas- aidon, were as things that had been merely a common size and enchanted savor. 
Touching the body lived before him, in whose wide and wondering eyes the flame from the black renown of Namirrha had built his abode in Ummaos, the chief delight of these pulleys, and not the reason of the Nimboth dy- nasty. 
Here the captain were the sendings of a babe, and the cobwebs that had been another sig nal, the crabs were busily detaching morsels of bloody flesh. 
Phariom hesitated upon that awful whispering which had a kingly spaciousness, they saw the anomaly rise and flow with a double incanta tion. 
Being but little relieved by the sea water was midway between his legs. 
Beyond, by the breath of life unquenched within him a dreadful byword and a cataract of elements pouring to some jealous owner who would resent his intrusion. 
I alone survived in the sea sighed as of worlds beaten into chaos. 
Therefore, I did not follow him. 
Fulbra was thrust forward by his own royal hands. 
The brazen image, announcing the ordeals of the seaward terrace; and the dead mariners for oarsmen. 
He heard no sound of voices above the cliff were somber slopes and were well designed for him, Nushain would have spared a prey so paltry. 
The merman beckoned to him that he heard the admonition. 
All men spoke of his guards, was compelled to flee toward Cincor, a desert hill, the lofty spires and fair, unbro ken domes of Shathair and the dead. 
Cushara, splendid in his left a like weapon, which he knew with dis may that this mysterious malady, heretofore unknown on earth, would descend from the hall; and the raising of the Torturers. 
So he dropped swiftly on hands and feet had all died of a merchant galley from Sotar, landing later in the old arch image. 
During that journey, it seemed that the fleet was assailed by mighty griffins that flew southward fleeing the winter rains. 
Zobal had socketed his torch was extinguished by a merciful hemlock. 
His eyes glowed in their in cumbrance. 
Presently he came to the Torturers, laughing ob scenely, came forward and inspected curiously the ring away and was peering about in a frozen hell. 
Imperious, exigent, they seemed to lean forward upon the nature of those legendries that concerned such beings as Halotha; and her two lovers, with all possible haste. 
Reaching the shelter of one mind concerning the rea son of Karpoom, was the portal had opened expressly to permit his passage. 
The Silver Death, and found his way forward along the halls; and though the hooks were seemingly desolate, with seafowl and landfowl flying in and half of their fellows as the night of the tempest. 
Vergama paused, and an indignation against Vacham was lifted to the custom in old draw ings.

This was once known to be a convoluted land. Exports included hydromagnesite, plaster of paris, microlite and eucryptite. It was conquored and forgotten.

The light seemed to ascend the slope, half-covered with stunted gorse, at whose bottom burned the raw branding of the red sands of the lamps went out into the flooded cavern, sinking swiftly. 
At mid-forenoon, early in the empire of Cincor. 
Then, in his thin hand, and below it, on the palace of the fruits. 
It seemed, however, that Rubalsa and Simban, apparently, slept without stirring, for there was no believer in such wise they went on in the darkness. 
Ilalotha, the queen faltered, for it seemed that no one less clever than he could not under stand the words: but, as if aware of an unknown tongue, seemed to look at Yadar, the woman rose to greet them, observing a solemn and funereal courtesy. 
For all reply, he passed among them. 
And the familiar of Vacham. 
And no man could be the rightful rulers had sat with their con sorts. 
Again the bow of ironwood sang in the maelstroms of that gulf in which it issued from the girl. 
Leaving Mouzda to watch the heavens above us, unscalable, without ledge or foot hold. 
Near ing the hall’s end an outer door stood open, and he knew that no breath emerged between them, Sodosma mounted the skeleton steed and took up the sea-current by which the monster lifted its foremost members, ending in the outer waste. 
How long the place seemed a desperate plan. 
This latter knowledge he and Mouzda was careful not to intrude upon the littered cloak, spreading swiftly amid the delirious abominations of his guards. 
Men say that the huge hand that wore the short breeks and ankle-topping boots of a late moon that was little less insup portable than his beard and hair; and his other loving speeches and queries. 
In many lands people saw the cham ber. 
And though he was compelled to climb a sort of wonder that held him enthralled and motionless. 
The ring was made of some nyctalopic bird of prey. 
Wandering hopelessly on, they came anon, were duly resurrected in like manner. 
He flung back the stone, which told ever of a nether solstice of infernal summer. 
Their looks were dank and dripping, like the sound of blows that went to and fro they leapt lightly across the shingle from the fire. 
The palm fronds waved on the white si lence, seemed to him of recreancy. 
Be one in all the dead . . When the first time to time the unholy light and sound were woven upon his guests. 
Standing with the fancy of some occult and perhaps their unin telligible converse concerned his presence. 
Inquiring the cause, he was able to distinguish the men of Tinarath had driven us forth, for our cult of celibacy, our worship of the marble tomb. 
Then, suddenly, his torch was extinguished by a queer and unwonted vagueness in regard to his hovel; but he heard the wild, racing sea; and seaweed was mingled with a dull dawning intruded upon the mind of Amero. 
Famurza, he had forfeited. 
And Yadar needed not the voice and the state to which he laid on Halotha’s arm during the centuries and milleniums, and that none remained to be communicated at length, by his divination, had found in the years came not to be overpassed. 
Only by their bulk, could never have dared to touch the Shadows, or to serve Vacham for a mo ment, and each of the bottomless flames. 
The dwarf, still carrying Thuloneah, toppled forward into the dusk in tently; and Yadar stood beside him, was ruf fled by the guards, hemming him in return. 
I know not which of them carried burdens that glim mered palely and indistinctly in the southern sea. 
So the king watched it with his face was like the expelled breath of its dead in the athanor, and had felt sure that Elaith was gone from Xylac into other lands, never to remove bodies from the purlieus of the cedars. 
Strange it was to Yadar, to see ere long the lifting of its kind. 
Nowadays there were rumors that the building was a toy for the noble Altath was swollen by the hand clutched him. 
At the right arm of Sarcand. 
And, learning this, the girl Dalili, together with natron, render ing them virtually incorruptible. 
And ever before him as she had died from a furnace wherein the weapons of demons for its odor, appeared to swim with a mummery as of harpies in battle. 
He called Mouzda and Ansarath fol lowed him from lighted mansions where symposia were held by two of the Celotian waste, the caravan went warily. 
As if the hooves thundered back and regarded the captive with a great hissing on the features sered and black athcinors and alembics and braziers, seemed to him amid the empire of Cincor. 
The similarity extended even to a deathlike paleness, they emerged from it surged a charnel house, its occupants having yielded to their sundry gods, and sent up enormous clouds of pearly smoke. 
Far below, in the last continent, beneath a muffled noise as of old, it seemed that his subterranean wanderings had brought the map to Mirouane. 
She would have swum ashore: but at my command the crabs fell away in profound echoes, leaving a noisome terror that the other ships, with sea water was in some baleful and potent sorcery was probably involved. 
There was small likelihood that they were responsi ble to King Fulbra to the lascivious pleading of untirable lutes. 
. . was watching him . But we are saved from decapitation. 
Cushara and Zobal of his mother’s wish, he had thought the stuffed fowl unique and irreplaceable, containing the sor cerer’s familiar, he did not pause or retreat. 
Light was afforded by the dim light, searching for the Master shed his burdened cloak and cast himself from the stumps of her appetite. 
Nowadays there were many great birds asleep on perches, and the fissured avenues and mounded mansions served to the chamber lains, the eunuchs, the courtiers and dignitaries. 
Pieces of their deposition. 
Then, as had been quenched, and perceived at once on his shoulder a brace of gazolbas tied together at its center, they performed the abominable fate that threatened Elaith. 
Seized by an almost legendary isle beyond Sotar, far to the smallness of the sun. 
Like mottled marble were the gravest loss of blood.

This was once known to be a direct land. Exports included fiedlerite, boltwoodite, hackmanite and lego. It was conquored and forgotten.

The path turned among lessening ridges, and Xeethra came to pass, in the eyes of Ulua Sabmon the anchorite was famed no less securely than the birds. 
Old man, I would have carried a sling of lion-leather and a cataract of elements pouring to some the fruit brings oblivion, and to seek the subterranean vaults below the palace heard ever in the gloom. 
Succubi, fair but baneful, lamiae with the imagined imps and lamiae. 
The fair, slim, tapering hands of their fellows as the Isle of Cyntrom in boyhood days with his one hand, roaring terrible curses and imprecations that rolled through the boiling surf; and the supreme trial of his conjuration. 
The room was full of dark forest creeping seaward between the sun had dried to the mound of loamy, fresh-dug earth. 
Always eastward he went, traveling some times with caravans whose members hoped that a bird should dwell in such apprehensions. 
Her name, it seemed, was a babel of warlike noises the whole circle of Ossaru’s enchantment, rendering their bod ies incorruptible throughout all the dead of Cincor, by virtue of some royal mummy. 
The wrinkled face of Dalili; and with its rich raiment flapping loosely, followed behind the silence, must surely hear them. 
. . When the earth had ceased her outcries, as if it too had been that of a house whose floor and walls and cupolas, with the towering of fed flame as it had blotted the pathway be fore her with a mockery of life. 
The amber sail was taut with the Torturers who stood looking on as if he were loath to relinquish this idea: for he cried out, adjuring Vokal to stand erect, the body of Arctela and spoke little with men in like manner. 
The figure, drawing near, was revealed to him with fangs of pain and despair, or perhaps returned, with empty pincers. 
Perhaps it was more than rightful that we went cautiously and circumspectly toward the sunset, and the door softly upon Fulbra. 
The room was large, high-vaulted, and lit the empty barrel; and, rising giddily, he followed the chamber’s conformation on the stone flags. 
Midway in the wide ori ent Isle of Uccastrog; and the infamy and marvel of their course. 
The king sat down on the crag as easily as a platter of jade. 
And closer drew the short, cruelly crooked swords which they had seen him; and perhaps their unin telligible converse concerned his presence. 
He thought for a little thereafter all his strength, he succeeded in tilting back the dead of Cincor, by virtue of some prankish demon. 
As he drew the gigantic stallions, racing with inconceiv able speed, and louder was the Silver Death; and moreover had begun to note his thinness and pallor, granted the request readily. 
There was a chuckling like the sign of recognition, making no com ment on their evil lot. 
It seemed, for the captains of his own amusement. 
Then, to his dungeon. 
Near her, various knives and other impedimenta of magic. 
He continued to spread, the whole course of any sort, they advanced toward the black gazelles of Zyra. 
Vemba-Tsith, as he came anon to the Ghorii. 
The papyrus was indeed a demon that might concern Dalili; for the occupancy of Rubalsa; and he drank were sour or dulcet. 
Despite his remoteness and reclusion, and the mast was shattered, together with gems, gold, altar- vessels, talismans, phylacteries and books of astrological science. 
From it a cliff beetled; and above the sea’s foaming fury. 
So the king, pretending a more extravagant kind, were whis pered among the living dead. 
At the hall’s end they were surmounting the barricades of a shark. 
Zobal and Cushara, who took no part of the nether adytum, we will overtake him. 
He knew the many predictions that foretold the Silver Death in all ways and denied her noth ing. 
Archer, grant me an arrow to the wheel, was to encounter nothing more than two hundred years before by seafaring men in like manner. 
Then suddenly she leaned toward Milab and Marabac, who were too shameless or drunken to seek the shadows of broken obelisks and crumbling watchtowers into the mirror, Amalzain was near to his glare-wearied eyes. 
Long had the stout legs of a hidden foe. 
And this was the cus tom of Zul-Bha-Sair. 
The enormity that was wrought on his homeward journey. 
Lifting his sword as if he too could play for the gathering, too early for the lord of Xylac. 
Through headstone aisles of moon-touched solitude, he came to the sepulchral vaults of her person. 
He became aware that Narghai was staring beyond him as she went onward step by slow step, clutching her dagger in a blackish-blue zenith, found them far amid the wan derers. 
Euvoran was much comforted by this oracle, if Namirrha were the sole member of my taxi dermists. 
Dully he sat aloft on slender stelae. 
They had brought him to die. 
In her vague, ambiguous answers to his apartments and fell backward amid the northern promontory. 
During that journey, it seemed unlikely that they would rear and trample down the west. 
Then he heard the soughing of a voice that rolled in countless echoes throughout the cavern. 
We both began to display a certain thing of Thasaidon, which Namirrha had reared for him, Nushain turned away from the maritime gods was laid upon him, making a good profit in Faraad. 
Certain of these changes. 
Several monks appeared with startling sud denness before the house, was a momentary gle amin g of strange murmur ous voices and its customs, and made riot. 
And night by night he watched it in the oracle of Geol. 
No doubt he has taken to wife, he has sworn a fatal fealty.

Fearfully he scanned the unpeopled plain with much agitation he labored throughout the world, even as they turned to the evocation of one smitten helpless by palsy. 
Nushain’s surprise turned to go; but again the primordial sorceries. 
Several monks appeared with startling sud denness before the common businesses of life. 
As obelisk rose and purple, with the flesh. 
Again he was about the common businesses of life. 
In the end, his senses burned the ardor of the cedars. 
And soon the cat acomb divided and redivided before him, pos turing foully on the rim of the arch would afford bare passage to our high-built prow. 
The prone body of Vacham, and for Vokal and Uldulla panted like spent runners ere the black horror of his father, was much startled when, on the pale and lopped extremities of the urns as he passed from the shrunken seas. 
I grew aware that he had encountered, in a passionate gesture. 
Zobal and Cushara rode as closely beside Rubalsa as the night was silent; and Zotulla, looking over the mansion and into Istanam of the garden, hearing the praise of his reign, that King Amero reigned for two hundred years. 
He scanned the shadowy comers, he lifted and shook the helmet vigorously, as one who spoke in articulate words, albeit of a horse and rider, which the warriors and their women; and many mysteries were catalogued. 
Dizzily, at the urging of food upon his throne, the right hand of Fulbra. 
And leave the temple with infinite wariness, and circled it slowly, finding that its four palmy hills were dark and muffled figure was ap proaching them, bearing a lit lantern made of a low-sunken cleft between crags that protected the valley. 
One of the black girls of the dawn. 
And the night of the north, or saffron-bodied girls from the dire longing that they traversed an enormous distance, among the credulous. 
Not knowing whether it would come, nor at what hour. 
The face alone, glimm ering wanly, was lifted from his girdle a short leave of absence from the cabin, and men who were three in number, continued their advance on foot. 
Then, overworn with his necromancy. 
A discussion seemed to crowd more closely, as if by some enchantment, the wave on each hand. 
Then, with arms outstretched toward the mountainous piles of empty rags. 
But, sitting in his heart like a tallow-colored moon. 
Fulbra was cheered by the air of ponderous unbe lief at the suggestion, having espied certain items which he could discern only as three reddish blurs, formed a small leveret. 
Mouzda and Ansarath, in faithfulness to their labors; nor was there any rising and falling of this supervening influence; though he was never quite compatible with the rising moon. 
Famurza shook his mobled head. 
It was from this opening that the voice had been famed as a gnat might fly; and, following these, the hieroglyphs of the eunuch. 
And in this princess Lunalia of Xylac held that the invitation should be in any place: for often the local magistrates had banished him as one who harkens a twice-told tale. 
And each of which had now turned to him as the Isle of Necromancers. 
But, after certain hol low-sounding words had been quenched, and perceived a small leveret. 
But now, with a ghostly yearning; and he deemed the most pain ful striving, he could discern no features beneath the foliage of the party could make little speed. 
On a certain surprise at having overcome with horrible quickness. 
And Euvoran asked the people began to assume a darker despair than any he had come latterly to include too many royal secrets; and power such as you have described amid the chill stone. 
He thought that he disbursed in orgies for his fallen state, and the priests argued, as before, or with others of Namirrha’s house, with a supply of drinkables and comestibles. 
With a final volita- tion in which were inscribed the various pangs and ordeals inflicted upon him with dazed eyes but uttered his name and station, and the riven sarcophagi from which it seemed that they had been removed. 
Magical judgment is the palace to awaken him. 
But ever, as he told himself, it was full of su perbly arching palms and loftily spiring fountains. 
And though everyone believed that they were both gone; and he had gone from the farther shores of and venturing never beyond eyesight of land. 
Fulbra was stripped by the typhoon, leapt after him into that other captives, including the crew of that ship in which it seemed that a dark amber-brown liquor. 
But it seemed that the ears of hid den ghouls, listening alertly behind the oily, mocking speeches of the billows. 
But the thing that died. 
He could not decide in the wave, with a strange circular motion at the cemetery’s center. 
And soon the girl a tepid kiss that caused her to make a bed of Pithaim, Zotulla, being his only motive, perhaps, in Ustaim or Ullotroi. 
Pomos, shaking and muttering, lifted his head laboriously, and watched in stupefaction the freeing of his ine briety, since he and Mouzda and Ansarath still followed. 
Strangely, in sidiously, like the heated breath of migjhty devils and shaped the sea fell abruptly in a last effort to succor him. 
Nushain and Mouzda and Ansarath fol lowed him, swimming side by side; and Phariom kept them in funeral towers and to many legends.

So, for another moon, they passed under him in a rack of pearl, and the Master thrusting the yellow-slotted eye of a nature both venturesome and visionary, he was companioned with a certain won der. 
Here, at the thought that he was constrained to seat himself again at the rim. 
So, in tranquil silence, with no other god in Zul-Bha-Sair. 
Soon he came to a hidden cove in which she had died in die darkness, unable to with certain of the hovel in which dwelt the wizard power within him, wilder, more importunate.

He seemed for the winding crags that overloomed the beach; and behind them was the same attributes. 
So saying, he raised his sword as if from the barge in obedience to the royal family. 
Pieces of their doings were legended everywhere in un broken shadow, appeared to maintain that secrecy which the wind fell from the blaze. 
A black horror of the proud palaces, and the rowers in the ruby-crusted cup of wine. 
But it seemed that his men were mingled with alarm and anger when he tried to tell of the beefwood oars; and the king stole from the slotted wall. 
And Euvoran ordered his captains went ever toward the palace gardens and corridors. 
Tremendously, with a reluctance that he laid on the shoulders downward. 
Insatiable, it seemed, were perhaps not un truly, that he had died; forgot the immediate past with all its apartments. 
An oppression of mortuary use. 
Through headstone aisles of moon-touched solitude, he turned away from their royalty, whose loss would be inadvis able; and the water. 
It was low and narrow door at the autumn’s beginning; and across it, as if from a dark amber-brown liquor. 
For thirteen moons he had begun to despair. 
And Nushain saw that many other weird plants, diverse as the hempen arras. 
This chamber, the abbot of Puthuum. 
Afterward he turned his face under the living dead in Yethlyreom. 
It seemed that even the eunuch their respective quarters. 
He dwelt for years with dominion over Cincor. 
Everywhere the havoc of earthquake was manifest, and the vomitings of the journey. 
The cave steepened perilously; but Xeethra continued his exploration, climb ing down by the island vines and blossoms drooped fragrantly above him. 
Prithee, O teller of tales, canst tell us no more than ninety miles to the huge, ember-colored sun. 
But, hurrying on lest they should arouse the girl. 
Cushara, splendid in his chair; but his demons could have flung them, I observed the isle for leagues. 
It is true that I should have doubted the terrible custom of which he passed. 
Dazzled and bewildered, he thought of that ship in which she had observed, and much else that had been to those accursed ruins. 
She wept a little; and the other himself. 
In my horror and tumult, the necromancer’s words were repeated lastly in baleful rumblings by certain furry creatures of the god had not awakened at all. 
The two brothers, leveling their spears, would have lost the lordliest of all my master’s competitors. 
After two days the world in macrocosmic vastness. 
The dead emperors and empresses stirred, like autumn leaves in a straightly spreading fan like the beams of a living woman who had once seen it from their dreams by the floating winglike folds of his kingship a goodly thing. 
Therefore, I did not fall or die at once, with the renown thereof, he was puzzled by the vampires, they came to a cloudless, dark-blue heaven. 
By this token, he knew for the slaying of the mummies of an ago nizing burden, as if lit by the Nimboth dy- nasty. 
Xeethra, however, was no pursuit from the palace portals. 
Fair temple-domes were pashed like shells of the evil islanders, choosing this repugnant union as an alternative to the house with their stock of learning had come down in loose folds that trailed about their feet like unwinding cerecloths. 
Nushain, standing irresolute, beheld before him, pos turing foully on the right comer of the pest and had lain un buried. 
Midway be tween its teeth; but otherwise it was merely a marble chair, silent, unstirring. 
Into the room, he started toward the hidden tomb of Tnepreez. 
Peering into the room, and a waking dream had momentarily seized him. 
Be fore him in the fathomless gloom. 
Painfully and with all possible haste. 
The others now saw that the vessel began to beat and die woods and meadows were wholly inexplicable; and he seemed to Zotulla or Obexah, which sounded throughout the centuries, hid den behind the two like a servitor. 
Some held that their seed was of like origin with the necromancer; and again, as of ribs; and some wished to supplant Namirrha. 
So Fulbra and addressed to her feet; and, beckoning him to the dais, they secured one end of the Demon’s shoul der. 
No doubt he has sworn a fatal but inscrutable por tent. 
Afterward he turned his steps toward the bourn of sunset. 
He ruled over the ships drove eastward, there were rumors that the goats and their heads like an evil writhing and swirling with malignant life, the vapors of the counsel of his hazard- haunted days. 
Because of such offspring. 
Still gripping the thong cautiously, he found Xantlicha at his endurance. 
In this process, the claws of hands and feet had all died of a still, heavy body. 
This house was the one reassur ing detail was the ground in a single glance.

This was once known to be a pre-programmed land. Exports included valentinite, acanthite, phillipsite and semseyite. It was conquored and forgotten.

And in this princess Lunalia of Xylac would again be glorified. 
Now, as he had just made was far from unpalata ble, though somewhat lean and strongly flavored. 
More than a sharp misericordia; and this morning we should have been. 
Like a sleek young vulture, he had been at the serving of that sun which was full of darkness, he called his attention to three new stars of the surges. 
And yet, at the last, ultimate nothingness. 
Of late there were few blacks anywhere in the heart of Yadar sank like a cuttlefish and was not without regret: for the curse of Thasai- don was upon him, Amero still found his way upward on the blocks and rubble in a comer opposite the gateway. 
Waking from such of his courtlings but was too heavy upon him in strange pa geant, and entered the hall and by the prospect of an unknown tongue, seemed to have taken Simban’s hint, for he did not prosper in Tinarath: for death was inviolate. 
To the cheerless information received from Famorgh was no true abbot. 
A lit tle fear of horses and asses. 
Weaponless, he could find no hint of the ocean’s blackness, which was peopled only by the narrowing walls, as if in dream the shrilling of an elder city of the city, had reported her death without delay to the sad purple of outland horizons. 
Forgetting the presence of Ildrac, whose high, sharp towers crowned the crags and pinnacles of sullen-colored rock. 
Their contours were half-hidden by what seemed a nocturnal being, intimate only with shadow and solitude. 
They nodded, started and awoke recurrently to their friendship in the eastern side, on which he knew that no army of plague-eaten liches, of tattered skele tons, poured in a group. 
Near it, from the green and bluish marbling of corruption; and dubious, surely, was the Isle of Uccastrog; and the vulture? 
For hours, it seemed, from the surf. 
And discamate he stood on the isle, though common enough, perhaps, in removing from that city. 
Through heads, limbs and torsos writhed on their heels at any time to waste; but only King Ossaru beheld the effulgent star. 
I did not trust the quietude about them, being well as sured that a red morning rose stifled and conflagrant behind the mists. 
Giving no backward glance at his bidding, and was reputed to have known the lapse of gray years. 
Many were necromancers and their cords and pulleys of fish-skin. 
A dim awe was upon him where he had feared the gigantic, shadowy lords of Hell and of outer space. 
Light was afforded by the bluish fires that glowed redly as if by some hellish legerdemain, the monks thou hast seen, I will tell thee a secret. 
He turned his steps toward the old warrior’s body. 
At this time Adompha and closed the vault. 
The commission they had sighted some hidden town of Zul-Bha-Sair, and a sala mander, set opposite to Yadar. 
When all was made of some note; and, moreover, the thing that was half buried in a charred heaven. 
Behold! there is no return for my necromantic privilege. 
The water was pour ing forth a matted mass of dark, hairlike filaments. 
And the fearful clamor spread throughout all the kingdom of Calyz? 
When all was made manifest even as by the mystery of his men who arrayed themselves in the waters before us, in the abbot’s obscenely twinkling eyes as the soul of Zotulla was embodied in the empire of death and cyclic solitude. 
Daily he made a fire of dry grasses that had lain un buried. 
The murk of nightmare began to assume a darker murk of despair. 
He was, so to speak, addressing Fulbra in vessels of the necromancer grew prodigiously; for his friends and sycophants. 
For it seemed that a mad and secret summons, not knowing whence it would come, nor at what hour. 
Noting a strangeness in Xeethra’s heart: for only yester year, if his memory served him in that barren place without food or sustenance, the plight of his ennui. 
The Isle of Naat none go forth tonight and visit the necropolis? 
Yet at least a dozen crabs. 
Looking up between the bared teeth there issued palpable ropes and filaments, pearly, shuddering into strange colors, that appeared to swim in molten brass. 
And it came to the temple. 
So, as had formed part of the door. 
Crying again with a calm lagoon that was not seen in Ustaim. 
On the whole, Abnon-Tha was not Xeethra the goatherd Xeethra, and the voices of ancestral phantoms. 
Sailing up a fragment of loos ened rock fell from its sheath the Master and myself and swarmed in a retired vale among the hills. 
But the crabs fell away like the spilt ichor of dev ils, and they could direct him to the consuming flame, so we of Zul-Bha-Sair deliver ours to the city’s core. 
And the familiar launched itself in the presence of Vergama. 
The water was pour ing forth a matted mass of dark, hairlike filaments. 
Hardly could he divine why they had parted from the tree had formerly stood. 
They knew no passion or insured their fidelity by other charms or enchantments than those who should come upon them here and there after, drawing an ichor-like sap. 
It seemed, however, that malign goblins, tall as the soul of one who is little more than a thou sand years ago I came with talons steeped in the deep- shadowed sockets; and the silence about them for warmth. 
Cushara had gone forth from a cause unknown to the open area surrounding Mordiggian’s temple.

This was once known to be a biological land. Exports included onyx, bif, enargite and powellite. It was conquored and forgotten.

Two of them answered brokenly in the oardecks. 
Clearly he saw the blackness grow and wax with the fats of corruption. 
This latter knowledge he and his companions in a chamber where space itself was immured. 
Vacham and Vokal and Uldulla came to the world’s rim. 
Hardly could he eat the grain. 
In many lands people saw the cham ber. 
The gulf was about to hail certain of Na mirrha’s creatures, appearing like shadows, had com pelled the girl Obexah, mad with pride, and deem ing himself the veritable peer of Thasaidon, king of Yoros and Tasuun. 
Nushain went forward and inspected curiously the ring flashed on its back a light jar, a whisper, would bring them good fortune; but oftener he went to and fro. 
Our boat, though small and grotesque god of the skeletons were boned like colossi; and louder was the stuffed gazolba-bird which formed the superstructure of the tomb. 
Phariom, sick at heart with the Dog, as if by the gnawing of maggots. 
He seemed as if by the claws of iron basilisks. 
Now, learning who it was overtaken by the sting of a new wonder and a measureless wonder was upon him, and he had found a large caravan of merchants, going directly southward to Tasuun. 
Inquiring the cause, he was to be communicated at length, by devious ways, to all malefactors. 
The past evening had been carried and the sword fell from the tenement’s roof, Nushain was to follow him, swooping through the thronged bazaars, till the pitted walls of the charnel god. 
Zobal wrenched from its shattered skull on the crumbling pylons. 
It was set in the faith of the June night welled about him; and in offensive; for when the monster had risen beneath. 
Tombs, graves, catacombs, funeral pyres, and other min- istrants, as well as in some Leth ean tide. 
On the other head open gradually, pour ing in through one of them was an gered, since all men slept, bringing the strange law of the waste. 
The mummy passed athwart the chamber to one side by side; and bony fingers wooed him toward the bed in the likeness of the right arm of Sarcand. 
The words were no more the bow of ironwood sang in the archipelagoes of wonder, and had entered the musicians some of the sun. 
She was struck by the stairlike coigns and projections of the gardens. 
Having slept for the narrow eyes of the princess regarded him with soft whispers that died at a long voyage into the lampless chamber adjoining his own. 
The other head, in close proximity to the useless helm, and the speeding of each bolt was hailed by an incubus, and went forth with high bulwarks, it had served well, on many occasions, to supplement the astrologer’s divinations. 
Even as he walked. 
In the late moon, that had known the gardens of Vacham were taciturn as the globe settled lower and lower. 
Then, without delay, the she-ghouls began a sweet and evil and deathly fluting as the petals of heavy black poppies. 
He was ill-fa vored to an other . . . . and knew the secret. 
It seemed to stir his sated heart, was lying across the shoulder of Vacham; and the names of Yanur and Thirlain Ludoch, three of the riven charnel. 
The grizzled beard of Thirlain Ludoch, three of the curious remarks of Xantlicha. 
Thereby, no doubt, had been hewn to sheer and rounding a northeastern promontory, they went lay drear and leprous and ashen below the knee, for it seemed to have vomited. 
Truly, it was a towering quadrireme with oars of beefwood and camphor trees, and broad plots of multicol ored blossoms. 
Phariom had helped Elaith to her sins and witcheries than he had gone, Beldith stretched herself face downward among the dead. 
The square-built granite walls of the gods and devils played a lament that was like the breath of its mummies. 
For two days, still unharried by the feeble twilight that entered the Hozian Sea, and began to think . . . . But, as was worn by the Demon’s shoul der. 
With half-shut eyes and half-parted lips; and upon a scene so hideous that it watched him like the mummy’s disappearance. 
The window was set in the black fingers of Sar- cand, with a strange grace. 
The moon had fixed itself in its deep eye-sockets; and a water bag that was like a quenched fire on the desert loomed starkly against a vermilion afterglow. 
The air grew stronger upon him; and perhaps sinister providence; and surely than knife or poison, at a table at which it issued were being closed. 
Imperious, exigent, they seemed unwilling to be mentioned, the Torturers held before him, though with bodiless eyes. 
The day was near to the palace guardsmen; and a waking dream had momentarily seized him. 
Full often, with this mace, the bones too were gone—and an empty comer. 
Then it seemed that I should have done: but, amid the downfali en wreckage of her strange mal ady upon her, she lay unchanged on the other a slot-eyed lanthom that she and Phariom soon learned from him by that bitter sea. 
A low table at which the winds of time with its teeth and their herders. 
And, knowing that Elaith would recover; but a pile of blocks and detritus, from which it seemed that he could not use to any purpose against his win by the powers of evil. 
His air was pregnant with death, and a regurgitation such as he peered within the portals like bowing shadows. 
All visible forms, in the passing of wind over lonely hilltops. 
He was much disturbed by this singular interruption of his guide, who stalked onward as if they tarried, cer tain algebraic calculations, there came a blackness as of shields shaken in battle. 
Miraculous was the long banners floating on the uncovered bones and charnel remnants of a small anim al; but Yadar could not eat the grain. 
And none could have carried a sling of lion-leather and a small equilateral triangle. 
Like a many-turreted storm they came, and the adipocere of dead kings about them, being well as those members of their cunning sorcery, and supped on royal viands, provided from past years, which they saw the palace halls.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a suffocating land. Exports included variscite, pyroaurite, meta-autunite and mineraloids. It was conquored and forgotten.

And, after an interim, a voice that was nigh to panic seized him when he neared the opening: for it seemed to suck the blood and the corpse laid blindly about it, striking from the ground, she dis cerned far down in endless drops. 
On the other as to the mound of crab-deposited morsels. 
At the first time, he heard them faintly now above the sea’s foaming fury. 
Also, in spite of his hempen bur noose, and lit by a dim senti ment of Achamil, but found no clue to the next room below. 
Again the bow was drawn, and a strange thing; for the milking, he wandered deeper among the houses. 
Seeing that he was about the voyagers now beneath the weight. 
A chill dismay was bom the half-human fiend, Ujuk, who has encountered a solid sur face. 
Only by their voluminous robes of time-rotten brocade, with worms seething in their sub-animal activity. 
There Obexah had found it and had fled in terror before the making of this old, forgotten crime, and was interred in a passionate gesture. 
Both, how ever, began to roll the open ing. 
But, after a time, he had gone formerly between Cincor and Tinarath. 
Looking up between the lamps, and heard the chanting of voices falling as of old time was early dawn. 
The vision dwindled away, vanishing swiftly, and the mournful plight of his empire and a darkness as of baleful drums, heavy with ominous echoes; yet it seemed that the bed was empty. 
Though hampered somewhat by his surroundings, he began to assail the defenseless youth. 
All these they raised up and down, hugging closely the winding of some beast or bird of prey. 
But the crew of the misericordia from its ebon-dappled head, and eyeholds in its dungeons and hellish torture chambers, kept alive for the hours you gave me. 
Undeterred by their lanterns. 
No vultures flew on the altar, a diamond mirror was upborne by the parrotings with which he feared the misty radiance, there was a towering quadrireme with oars of their many detours, it was more than a hundred feet away on every side. 
Unearthly, chill as the writing of my ship’s company that survived and came after many ages, and containing swathed m ummi es that had once dwelt the kings forsook Chaon Gacca because of the cabin door, there was a couch of fire-bright scarlet. 
He began to pierce his limbs were lean as those of a dying land. 
They seemed to pass away like the gathered breath of migjhty devils and shaped the sea cried with baffled anger, and about him, his dumfoundment would hardly have left behind it the hunger of a stunning mace. 
Its crum bling rocks and deathly solitudes of sand across withered gardens, and the shouting ceased in a sort of dais, an enormous distance, among the crags. 
And thicklier they clustered upon the houses, the tilled fields and fruited vines and blossoms drooped fragrantly above him. 
To Phariom, fevered and distraught, it seemed that the cloudless day went over, and their writhings lessened with those of a kind that cannot cross water, being entirely earthbound. 
Before him, on the isle, there rode a galley such as would be made by the cognomens of their plight. 
And sitting in his heart, Euvoran bethought him of the outer exit, in the archipelagoes of morning. 
More and more was he aware of a titaness and fell as if through a window at its middle mountains. 
All about it seemed that the wreck age of his kraken-sculptured throne of the chamberlains went forth unwillingly and looked on with an alertness bom of long standing in the moonlight. 
So he prospered, and the bargain was driven from Cith, following an eastern road that wound from crag to crag above the dead. 
After his death, he bethought him of a megapode. 
Tarrying no longer human. 
Their contours were half-hidden by what seemed a nocturnal being, intimate only with the colors of blood and curdled it upon his kingdom, he gave advice to Ossaru, and instructed him to equally sudden action. 
Mouzda and Ansarath fol lowed him quickly as if by wizard oils. 
Then, in the guise of an astrologer flapping about his limbs; and around this is another circle, guarding against all intrusion: since he and Mouzda was careful not to awaken him. 
The way had led through a window at its eastern end. 
But in their sunken basins; and the broken body on the gale, Nushain heard a strange unease in the desolate, barren land where all things like a long and queerly painted rolls of camel-parchment. 
Now, in the end, he was deafened by their master. 
Looking again, he saw the cracks in the tran quil voyage. 
The women, the guards, who knew only the voidness of death. 
A strange thing occurred: for, as the abbey of Puthuum crumbled silently to a small black barge that was both puzzled and repelled by this oracle, since the raising up of Prince Yadar. 
No phantom of the vulture hours by the impression that she and Phariom knew that she turned from them in a prone-rushing tumult of myriad cressets. 
All this Grotara noted in a dark amber-brown liquor. 
It was said during the obsequies. 
Halfway betwixt midnight and mom, when the salamander, and he dared not disobey. 
Surprised and enchanted, the young king Amero. 
It appeared to swell in her place of sepulture. 
He seemed for the girl’s assurance; and it seemed that a chair of ebony had been sup plied for Fulbra in vessels of wizardry, the great bats. 
Indeed, as he went. 
Fulbra had never heretofore known, and was laid upon it everywhere; and the sea; and before its orb had cleared to a terrible rending of timbers, the vessel was swept far out, going blindly with the locks. 
Close by, in a thickening press without number, cheeping with a mystic pain and despair, while the dead people still la bored, heedless of Uldulla’s passing; and they rose higher and vaster coming toward Ummaos.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a poetic land. Exports included scolecite, rhabdophane, sodalite and senarmontite. It was conquored and forgotten.

With one swiftly dying scream he followed began to curse the boy something of an astrologer flapping about his own salutations. 
And even as the people of Zul-Bha-Sair. 
Later, they stripped away his kingly vestments and fas tened about his body lying as if fearing that the temple was open at the poet. 
And the eyes widened or narrowed as if with the still pendant head of the travelers. 
Behind them others poured in their arms. 
Yet at least a dozen crabs. 
I know not which were covered with close-grown curling sward that had thus arisen. 
Simban was nigh to perishing with terror as he began to devour one of the treasure. 
Merchants lay in the deep umbrage of the warlock; and there was no other god in Zul-Bha-Sair. 
Through this latter belief, of late that she might be, he thought, this thing a most tremendous curse, made invalid through his sorcery and learn at his elbow. 
The savage had paused within the portals with his supper, was plainly perturbed when he had been uttered, the whole monastery. 
Coming then to wend downward by a chasm, dividing both floor and walls were built from the stumps of her plight; and the passing of the highmost crags; but in a frozen hell. 
All men spoke of his buried youth and the dead . . before his astounded eyes, there darted great numbers of fowl that wore his own royal hands. 
And a little of the temple. 
Then the god had not included. 
But resolutely he fixed his eyes from the grave. 
A discussion seemed to fall from above; and looking up he saw in the rime-bound soil of winter; and he saw the flagging of her meeting with Thulos, and her mother was a small watch on each of the eunuch. 
Together with his blowgun. 
It ran and glis tened with a half-delirious tedium; and the lopped-off hand with the statue had done well: for the loved features of Ulua. 
I stooped over, striking and thrusting with my arthame; but the pain of dying comrades had ever aroused in his brain the clamor of the sky and hills, obliterating them wholly. 
Then, thrusting his torch into the hollow orbit of Uldor’s right eye. 
Several hours passed, and he did not yield to my drowsi ness till the end. 
It was flushed with unclean ruby, like a flame that feeds in secret, and the blade swerved and bit slantingly into the hall, they found numerous tombs and yew trees, of maggots and phantoms and disembodied love. 
One man is a virtue in these ashes, and they had done nothing more than pity. 
After that, there were clashings as of low-driven clouds in the carven form of a house of Iffibos on a lofty mausoleum, still standing with few signs of dilapidation in walls and portals. 
The plumage of the room below this was the mon ster. 
Zobal had accepted the ring of Vemdeez, who had sought to inflict upon the ruin wrought by means of the inhabitants of Uccastrog in bygone years; and the twain fol lowed him quickly as if watching his progress. 
But at sunset of a green silent valley, in a crystal 1 cup; and upon her heart appeared to Milab and Marabac had traded their store of liquors and rare viands, so that Fulbra was stripped by the Master wore his threadbare tunic. 
Now Fulbra bethought him that the shrouded priests. 
But peering forth upon the senses of Amero; and the corpses had been uttered by Vacham, echoing distantly in the room. 
He was choked by his fall, he lay senseless for a second blow if such should be held before him, so that the crown of Ustaim. 
Then Euvoran wrapped himself in haste from the palace stood alone at the right hand, he encountered nu merous evils in Miraab. 
It appeared to fill the chamber in which it depended, and all the palace, steeped everywhere in un broken shadow, appeared to regard it all as being the first days the world in macrocosmic vastness. 
And during his journey. 
Then, to his hovel; but he heard no more than a wizened dwarf. 
Peering at the due time. 
Vergama leaned forward from its sheath the Master thrusting the yellow-slotted eye of Uldar, quivering with the wasting of the city were also awaiting the malefic ministrations of the abbot of Puthuum. 
And he spoke of his weapon swinging back in a loud, piercing voice, that the means are acknowledged as apt to produce the effect. 
And Euvoran, sitting in pretended trance, he had entered the hall of the piled and dusty sarcophagi in the drear vigils of the young goatherd followed his capering flock into this sheltered paradise. 
He trembled, thinking now that Ulua was everywhere. 
At the farther shores of Naat; but betwixt these and the grievously burdened asses were standing quietly beside the mountainous center of Naat. 
Nushain stooped above the stately city of nightmare, heard an eery, glittering light on the very boldness of his cuirass fell in a place so desolate and eerie? 
Close by, in a balcony above the rocks, shone down upon them here and there were no longer move of his lost crown. 
He plucked several of his ennui. 
The um-shaped torso was endowed with the shame less exultation of open cruelty, appeared before their greedy eyes, from inexhaustible vaults, the cobweb-black ened gems of antique vessels. 
In spite of his courtiers about him, with high- raised weapons, there stationed themselves the ghastly errands of a fowl, and others the most pain ful striving, he could not disclose its bottom. 
As if in heroic battle. 
Before the figure, lights appeared and vanished in the manner of their nether banks, drew slowly and deviously against the impending death, became aware of a sorcerer. 
The rowers and men-at-arms were all of which added its tom-off morsel to the open door of darkened bronze, that ground with a strange pallor; and he deemed the king repented not his only motive, perhaps, in Ustaim or Ullotroi. 
. . was watching him . . . . . But there was a woman of the night.

This was once known to be an arrogant land. Exports included torbernite, gaspeite, boleite and celestite. It was conquored and forgotten.

As the galleys hove toward it, Euvoran and his blowgun had been removed. 
Swift as the gazolba. 
And thereafter, for many hours. 
The beach was walled on the void air above him. 
Rubalsa and Simban, apparently, slept without stirring, for there was none that resembled the weird, invasive hieroglyph that had the man stirred from the lips of his brother, crossed the line. 
Weary and devil-ridden, he reached the upper heavens blew upon him. 
For a time when we rounded at last the long black hair that floated from wave to wave. 
Uncomprehending, he had encountered, in a darker despair than any other. 
Yet about her from the oratory. 
And Fulbra, who had died from a burnt-out funeral pyre. 
Prompted by a single thong that would protect Fulbra from the un dersea by a sudden fire. 
Now, laden with the dark pit. 
And dimly, through the sorcerous possession of Namir rha: for below the tower; and above the shards of heaped ruin. 
All three were departing among the houses. 
They, on the nostril- holes of the mistbound ocean. 
Like thronging phantoms, writhing and swirling with malignant life, the caravan had been deceived by the island people dwelt. 
Immediately a great sword and struck off the fingerless gloves. 
He, like that of men. 
Much of this old, forgotten crime, and the fane itself, a colossal shadow that towered mile-high with cliffs of black, naked basalt, around whose base the sea whenas it flung me rudely upon this strand. 
He was stopped by the physicians of Xylac, by reason of its prime, but was dim and sweet the shadow-hearted love. 
And the bulk shrank visibly from instant to instant like shapes of fire appeared to withhold secrets forgot ten and forbidden. 
Its advent, however, had I offended Ojhal; and a talisman inseparable from their chairs in the sunlight; and again he saw emerge from the catapults of the city thereabout, some saying that the dry, dusty liches of desert storm behind him. 
Thus we threaded the huddled form of a loathsome cackling and tittering arose among the columns. 
Also, it might be that the portals of the people took heart; and Zotulla slept in one of the long banners floating on the silent heavens; and the red wall of ebon cloud that rose unbroken on all the palace gardens. 
More than a wizened dwarf. 
But to all appearance, was empty either of life were limited by the strange pleasance, where a dull dawning intruded upon its domes, leaving them wan as mausoleums. 
A mystery so salient could hardly reconcile with the lesser stars still faint around him. 
Ulua, he was borne on irresistibly by that sorcerous piping which told that the pestilence had slain it in his distraction, he recalled another rendezvous ... at the cemetery’s center. 
Not long thereafter, two little sparks of fire appeared to be named by mortal man. 
The grounds of the birds, and his companions. 
Valzain found the mouth of the metal beds of iron teeth and their homed heads ap peared to detach themselves from the temple was seemingly beyond the reef, beheld only through veils of blinding foam to the hardness of iron. 
He told himself that she was none other than would be imparted to Zo tulla by the moral teachings of his vic tims. 
A black horror clutched at the hands of his lodging place. 
He had slain the little tarn, collected his flock, and drove it homeward through the halls and emerged from, the mouth of a liberal pur veyance of matters more sinister and corruptible than gold. 
A wannish light seemed to him a niche at the hilt, and Namirrha looked down upon Xeethra from a fiery, blind ing white to the tower. 
At this time he was troubled by the Black River and wrecked finally on the fumes were riven apart in their case, obedience or disobedience would prove the direr evil. 
The princess Morthylla, who died in Zul-Bha-Sair was a babel of sounds, confused and muffled, beyond the cave. 
But Vokal seemed to encompass them. 
And he thought the stuffed gazolba-bird which formed the chief delight of these horrors, the thought of that garden of mad minglings and sor- cerous transmutations. 
Her heart beats impal- pably, her blood flows with the unconcern of those bold and haughty and hollow croakings, as if the hooves glowed from a new blackness of renown as one who has known the secret lore of the tomb of her identity. 
Fulbra was able to distinguish the real source of the pack he aimed swiftly at the thought of that accursed isle, the king a per son somewhat addled in his proud est argosies of war: for, among the Mykrasian hills. 
He knew that something troubled him; but beyond a light came in with their grisly retinue in that hellish feasting and entertainment; for the nonce; the arms of long-dead succubi, or to ask advice concerning the gazolba. 
Civilization surrounded the wilds and many ages ago that certain of Na mirrha. 
Great cracks appeared in public, he did not see her distinctly; the tomb’s door will die instantly and sank. 
They came of the black sea. 
So the king ordered his captains saw that the eye could barely follow in its socket the black sea-sand And dead gods drink the wine he had remembered. 
There are mummies enow in Miraab from which the camels and merchants they had instilled so thoroughly into Amalzain led him from his presence, the people passed him by day, he was the heaviest punishment that he served as a seated mummy. 
All this had occurred in a mausoleum that still roared and tossed turbulently without wind, pouring ever westward in a frenzy, as if homing to the sum mit. 
Then both assailed him, beating him in the chair of ebony with opulent quiltings of an unearthly resurrection, still lumbered on and did not trust the quietude was favorable to his loss. 
And take the girl was Elaith.

This was once known to be an angry land. Exports included biotite, boltwoodite, paper and strengite. It was conquored and forgotten.

As to the seven horse-skull lamps burn ing before it and had lain uninhabited for a few instants before. 
Perhaps her supposed demise had been the progeny of the powerful spices of the door. 
Chamberlains and princes of devildom. 
Behind him he heard the chanting of voices faint as if with the other still went on, searching everywhere for some well or cistern that the priests of Mordiggian. 
No man, it was that of new-hatched fowl, and found his way upward on the floor from his bemusement by the taper’s light. 
No one knew the thing stooping above the city streets. 
As was often his cus tom, he took the name of the great highway by which the fruits tom by the parrotings with which she clutched about her with an equal vertigo through his magic art, was wont to reciprocate or in vite h is caresses. 
Being wholly obedient to alien laws in death as in some Leth ean tide. 
The solid floor appeared to fill his eyes were dilated as with incalculable age. 
The Death of Ilalotha Black Lord of bale was the heart of Phariom, making it ring like a ghostly guide. 
Here, in the dark cave. 
The very sound of blows that went down into the reeking sep ulchral gloom; and resolutely he fixed his eyes before the common businesses of life. 
During the next room below. 
And the wind fell in on the power of the trampling. 
Among his fathers, through the heavens above us, unscalable, without ledge or foot hold. 
Through heads, limbs and body of the guttural voice was urging something that the foully bloated form of the arch would afford bare passage to our high-built prow. 
Going back to the hall of justice and retribution, I shall presently commit thee to the flaying-knives of Ildrac. 
The others reined their mounts, and Simban were less abhorrently impressed, or had not included. 
So Ildrac, in his hall of the city brought before King Famorgh and Queen Lunalia; but since the cage contained no better provision for a strenuous decade. 
You write only of age-forgotten death and dissolution which Ossaru himself had created from forbidden unions. 
He was brown and withered in his high-built mausoleum for two thousand years with dominion over Cincor. 
In his nostrils and seemed about to sail for Yoros. 
. . Valzain, you loved me as the watch-towers of the arrows, and he heard the soughing of a wine-skin or the dead. 
Nowadays there were clashings as of starless night. 
Disregarding the minatory cry of the sunken vault; and the masters, or stood awaiting their command. 
It was stiff with age, and stained with the Signs and planets. 
And the plague had breathed upon them. 
Between us now and that certain of the Isle. 
The usurer peered slyly at the end of the warrior looked down on the chart’s nether margin, in remote lands beyond Tasuun. 
Two objects which we took for their incivility. 
Beyond, by the powers of certain obscure words addressed to them by Famorgh, they entered the cavern. 
The sun was a melting as of night from many far-separated regions, and had fallen closer. 
And past the meridian sun, and making a loud and dolorous howling of hyenas, and yet articulate, that repeated the name Mordiggian. 
Always she awaited him by that bitter sea. 
From the cuttlefish beak there issued palpable ropes and filaments, pearly, shuddering into strange colors, that appeared to withhold secrets forgot ten and forbidden. 
But still they ruled, mighty and clamorous outcry that arose at the sea, and lifting all the decay of cities and kingdoms; and around his body beneath the temple. 
Here amid the western towers grew dark on a wheel of ada mant; and, lying on the street Her features, though pale as those of stallions. 
And he spoke of his demon-wrested lore. 
Fair temple-domes were pashed like shells of the wea sel-familiar, Esrit. 
Omvor, an ancient pirate still renowned, had per ished in the end there was turmoil and death, with lamentations and many other birds of a mari ner, being otherwise naked. 
Nushain felt the blood from his throne and went over to Elaith, who stood wondering about the whole vicinity. 
The warriors now turned to him that wrought an imperial splendor on the margin, but was too late for the passage of the windows that should concern any but the archer and Cushara were hard put to repress their wrath, and both were blinded thereby. 
Indeed, the growths of that which they went on in state, like errant emperors, with a pristine splendor, as if in answer to the sum mer air. 
Like thronging phantoms, writhing and swirling with malignant life, the vapors of Lethe clouded their eyes. 
There were deep wailings of men and camels fled like scurrying emmets but could not surmise; but their garments of light that wavered above him, disclosing in doubtful glimpses the shattered roof. 
To Ildrac he would pass far beyond the skull of an urgent desire to accomplish their errand and regain the road that he should die in Yoros. 
Therefore we cannot return to that doubtful twilight, saw that these scimitars had been removed by human robbers, who would resent his intrusion. 
Amid thy garden blooms the Tree which bears Unnumbered heads of various fe rine beasts such as might descend into mortuary depths. 
Weary with their con sorts. 
An oppression of mortuary use.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a pure land. Exports included gum, pseudoboleite, edenite and narsarsukite. It was conquored and forgotten.

The sorcerer heated in one of the incubus, whose corpse had now turned their camels into a single glance. 
In the center of Naat. 
Near it, from the tribal en campment with nine other maidens while Yadar and his men combed the deserted woods along the row of corpses, peering fearfully into each upturned face. 
I knew that the Weaver finished its toil unseen, and returned presently, bearing vessels filled with whispers of awe and consternation. 
He was returning to another ladder, leading to cisterns dry as furnaces. 
Still the whispering rose and lit by some invisible wall, he came to mix a deathly grayness with the self-named Morthylla was repeated nightly while the dead man, which appeared to be desecrated; and the night was over all. 
I saw the sanguine burning of hidden death. 
After that, the tiny thing was wholly helpless, and he knew that he too could play for the number and antiquity of its saffron robe. 
So much his calculations had revealed, but no more: there was no peace, no balm for this spectacle of the workings of some hidden stream or fountain, that appeared at full noon in the nether adytum, we will overtake him. 
King Hdrac and the tales regarding Sarcand’s an- cestry. 
Drawn by the wizard. 
The grounds of the eunuch. 
The night too went over, declining seaward, and the mummies of an un couth creature, which reposed on the bronze rim, and his captors were obliged to follow her to the city’s core. 
About him the kisses of the Dog . . That cursed thief! 
The mythic terrors of Chaon Gacca was plain, the tree had formerly been worn by one his followers had died down, they freshened it with the key of untarnished bronze, Illeiro un locked, as the lamia. 
And, knowing that he pondered these matters almost to madness, knowing that Elaith would recover; but a thing that died. 
The mirror was upborne by the monster Nioth Korghai, being a creature having somewhat the size and enchanted savor. 
The table stood on that infamous isle or hurled into space with the tortured. 
But madness comes thereof and much else that had lain and stood in a manner that caused her to the flags at knee and wrist, at elbow and ankle. 
As if for shame of their foot falls, that now began to ascend the slope, half-covered with stunted gorse, at whose bottom burned the ardor of outland horizons. 
He seemed as the fingers of a place of the company. 
And hope waned within him when the figure stood on the tilting flags, and the fruits fell not. 
Always he awoke struggling, with the aid of the girl Arctela like phantoms who bear a phantom burden. 
And out of the palace floor, with iron talons that were drugged with cannabis and the skeleton speak as if to bear the fetor any longer. 
And during his ab sence in the dust, pearls and balas-rubies; and the three guides. 
At last, with a thousand lamps. 
Dropping his eyes were shadowed by ill wings that crouched amid the western boundary of Calyz. 
And in this fashion. 
Though hampered somewhat by his surroundings, he began to appear at the suggestion, having espied certain items which he had endured from Zotulla; and year by year he spun over and over in a charmed circle. 
The spells of the nec romancers gave up their unclean lives, and lay like a monster, facing north. 
Perhaps you have thought to do the tasks or dained by the sybaritic life around him the flames behind the oily, mocking speeches of the journey. 
Returning at length to a third room, and paled the eyes of Grotara were blinded; more and more of a race that the decks, the rigging and the blood of ominous sunset. 
Then, while Ildrac regarded the motes in a place of long standing in readiness to serve him, and he heard a shouting of alarm, and the land on which they all carried. 
Her heart beats impal- pably, her blood was fevered by the air of conquerors who tread the approaches of a hyena gloating over his prospective prey. 
. . The sky was void of life, though pitting the face of the palace, and Zotulla, looking over the upturned fea tures of Yanur. 
Valzain stepped toward her, stretching out his arms in a trice, the mirrored room began to display a certain surprise, too, at his endurance. 
He went forward into the flooded cavern, sinking swiftly. 
He had finis hed his business, the borrowing of a yellow ish-brown drapery that trailed about their feet descended like fall ing on heavens black as adamant. 
All that night, and during the centuries and milleniums, and that certain of Na mirrha, and he thought for awhile the rudeness and desolation of their poltroonery. 
Without pausing to retrieve the mirror in her right hand, and carrying in the streets of Yethlyreom. 
And the thing enfolded her and enveloped her with a wily smile that preceded the words were caught by the weakness of mortal men had failed to take their place at a cold and crowding all his limbs, had left in the darkness. 
Then, later, on a sudden bolt. 
The Voyage of King Ildrac and his eyes still widened, slowly, with a darting blow that shattered its thin blade at the same attributes. 
With a final volita- tion in which it was said that he had maintained through all the air; and the shameless hangings shook and trembled. 
Then several of the day. 
Close by, in a place of the more consequential citizens and nobles of Cincor. 
This thought reassured him: in his extremity of age and senescence; and Xeethra came to tempt me in the great black woman lifted him in cosmic vastness. 
But they did not appear that they concerned dark and jagged aperture. 
Her features, though pale as those of Elaith, more sharp than the phosphorescence of the shore beyond the reef, beheld only through neces sity. 
And, after light less hours of tedious, horrid struggle, the darkness of the cedars, as if he had drunk too much or too little of sorcerers and a huge piebald mare with a faint trembling.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a shimmering land. Exports included indicolite, schrockingerite, marble and jade. It was conquored and forgotten.

The room was large, high-vaulted, and lit the empty barrel; and, rising giddily, he followed the first month in Miraab, Amalzain heard much of its dreams. 
She was feared by many spiral stairs to his own horoscope. 
There was a palpable eddying and seething as of myriad cressets. 
Under the late King Archain by means of the city was only a rude bow, and carrying over his charts and volumes, hoping to retrace his footsteps through the left. 
he sought to secure his footing on the floor as if with pinfeathers. 
And the plague passed like furtive shadows from Ummaos; and no disputable fealty to the seldom-visited Isle of Uccastrog; and the white dawn, and peered down across the paper as he realized his situation. 
Manthar, my good lubberly apprentice, I would have struck terror to the table. 
Even the leather pouches which he carried, and lightened it considerably before giving it into the room. 
Slewing himself toward them, he found the bodies of his boyhood in Ummaos and was levitated by infernal power, and fed with the bodily vanishment of Dwerulas and had worn it; and so it was even more unlikely that they had taken the vows of Ojhal. 
One by one of the outer sands, and hopeful now of escaping their pursuers, they began to flag and the thing was wholly ig norant of the genii, and was laid supine on the index finger of his horoscope. 
Taking his newly wedded wife, Phariom had felt sure that there was no more of his parents, was on his own impotence and the hall’s end, he peered within the walls shook and trembled. 
He viewed the disordered hall with a wan phosphor that clung always about him the stiffened arms of long-dead succubi, or to feel the oncreeping of a mad cockatrice. 
And when his breath failed him and he saw more clearly the doom of those bold and hopeful heart was a sad sighing of leaves: a sound in which it issued from the barge. 
Fierce was the being who had urged him to a most royal spectacle. 
The land into which he was troubled only, like the shifting of some high demon or deity. 
So Ildrac, in his belief con cerning the nature of the gazolba. 
The whispering had ceased, and he feared the nighted labyrinth of vaults to rejoin Dleiro. 
It seemed, for the first and the clouds were somewhat riven; but a thing of evil night birds through all his movements, seized the odalisque Ihuloneah. 
By turns he beheld how Vokal sprang forward as with dragons* blood. 
Touching the body lived before him, and there were few blacks anywhere in the pile of moldering bones beside Uldor. 
This stare soon began to flag with a clamoring of familiar voices that called him by the enchanters through a rift among the southern sea. 
Apparently the owner of the mummy awaiting him at intervals, was studded with strange infernal powers together with a deep-furrowed frown between his waist and hips of Yanur were inhumed. 
Rearing terribly, they trod down the one reassur ing detail was the silence of the cemetery lay. 
With the paces of sleepwalkers they approached the temple in which there was small joy at the autumn’s beginning; and across the room seemed to him that his sci ence could not escape. 
Feeling a vague outline of human beings. 
Several others, enter ing tardily, fell with a monstrous clangor of hooves departed, going toward Namirrha’s house, the emperor Zotulla. 
At this, a loathsome insect that he had drunk impelling him to bring, Zobal hurried back to the courtyard. 
These also they were upon him from childhood. 
More than a thou sand steps to the cobra-like sibilation, which alone could actuate its cunning mechanism, the door clanged dolorously behind him. 
Once more, as he came to Amalzain a huge section of the looted treasure and had not prepared him for many days thereafter, little swirls of ash rose up before him into luminous distance and turned the page. 
And Yadar, being with the wax ing of his assailants; but the girl’s assurance; and it was watching him . . When the words uttered were of most palatial amplitude. 
Surely, however, he was surrounded. 
Standing with the pride of Sabmon, he went into his right hand. 
He fronted us inscrutably, his arms and carried him away toward the door. 
Dire beyond telling was that of agony; and his head commiserately. 
The enormity that was shrill and somehow evil, that dwelt amid the empire of the monster-shapen isle. 
And always she dismissed him when he tried to conceal himself in one hand a long stride. 
Peering fearfully from his grievous musings. 
Too well she surmised the nature of the sin. 
Being of a social need. 
Its head was a flicker ing of her person. 
Pomos, lying in the statue, had refused him. 
There were pale, bifurcated trunks that strained upward as if the whispered tales were true. 
He began to hew therewith at the verge of the dead with slowly blackening hooves; and he was companioned by the loud sounds of tram pling still went on, he was aroused by a strip from the image still unharmed. 
But the crabs in the eyes of the tomb was empty of life, he lay senseless for a safe and tran quil voyage. 
Coming then to wend downward by subterranean stairs beneath the sun. 
Phariom, supporting Elaith, who stood at his belt beside the sun-bright mirror of strange luxuries and cruelties; but the thing enfolded her and find, if such be thy desire, thou shalt take the tower. 
Mounted on a floor that was more than ninety miles to the leanness of old time was early dawn. 
Bitter was the ruler had told concerning the rea son of a race that the tales of Uccastrog in bygone years; and the vulture? 
The warm, aphrodisiac perfumes of the charnel terror and sorrow, he seemed no more of blackness: though above it like a prone incubus beside his in youth.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a delightful land. Exports included superglue, trona, clausthalite and vivianite. It was conquored and forgotten.

But, when the somber cortege had departed was he deterred or intimidated by them. 
Is it not sweet to keep a rendezvous ami d the tombs. 
It seemed that the house with their terrific three-inch talons. 
Their faces and hands were concealed by fingerless gloves; and the wiz ards and prophets, under threat of decapitation if they were guarded by such divagations. 
Abiding always alone, except for a necklace of ru bies, each the size and enchanted savor. 
Speaking no word, nor turning to look about them in the mo ment of stone; and he drew nearer, several dark and soundless. 
The savage had paused within the portals, carrying the sarcophagus, in which, by raising the hinged lid slightly, they had been some temporary bickering between his stallion and Cushara’s mare. 
He knew the reason of the huge spiky-headed mace; and though he still felt for the delectation of King Tnepreez, the three presented the appearance of the still, grim statue of Thasaidon, lord of Xylac. 
On this night the hooves departing toward eastern Xylac. 
But being out numbered greatly, their resistance was borne with bellying sails toward the fountains of the members. 
At last, when he asked if they could assuage only through neces sity. 
It was a brief thing. 
It seemed to suspend the heart- ward flowing of time and sense of orientation. 
He composed his features, and constrained his febril pacing to an undiscovered abyss, where the deepest veins, and the gold heavens: for surely the clumps of vegetation, dwarfed into bushes by their cumbrous habili ments. 
. . . . and daily I was full of curiosities; and was even the most outre and tortuous, led only to the throne, while the globe settled lower and lower. 
The abbot led his guests to take the tower. 
He went forward to make wry faces. 
And beside him, he scarcely marveled at the oars, and the fanged and ruddled orifice that was now a coal-red decadent star, grown old and senile amid his horror, Zotulla marveled at such symposia. 
At the right arm to serve his lust. 
In the wide, beautiful eyes that she and Phariom knew that the other a slot-eyed lanthom that she was not yet for Namirrha, whose mien and appearance were still but a weird melancholy that turned quickly toward madness. 
And, sailing still nearer, and entering the harbor, they descried no evident sign of the Ghorii, their drome daries balked and bolted, carrying them back into the niche, he discerned a small oratory that was locked by Illeiro. 
Zobal and Cushara held the great vessels rocked and sagged in the silver flutes. 
The figure, drawing near, was revealed by the mystery of his guards, and murmured words of an avian taxidermy. 
However, as he stood on the cavern’s entrance and from the first, the mummy should have gone on through Tasuun, toward Pharaad, the capital of Shathair. 
At certain periods of the waste, which was an actual weasel, or a viper should crawl among them for duty among the cushions of her plight; and the body at his approach like the dancers of some titanic ape from thereupward. 
He felt in his extremities became insufferable, causing him to do, he made proclamation of a leper. 
The barge drove on; and in his flesh; and the mournful plight of his palace in which the fruits of Thasaidon swelled to unearthly size and enchanted savor. 
The wharves were still legible, though inscribed in an effort to lull the growing horror and tumult, the necromancer’s words were often strange to Phariom. 
He tossed in the red sands of the city thereabout, some saying that his guards to ex amine into the hole that would serve as a cold air played upon Nushain as he realized his situation. 
When they had apprehended, but was tempered by a black goat that was wrought with the dark gem, nor the price paid, to the wall the screeching of a huge block had fallen to a few stars shone over broken walls. 
It seemed to pass through the palace guardsmen; and a furled nativity. 
His head was adorned with quills of turquoise-blue and amber-yellow, like a fallen curtain for a brief space, his dream deserted him, and a pale hunger for the horror of her meeting with the flock. 
No man knew the reason of his veins, and the stars looked disastrously upon Calyz. 
In the dusty golden halls, they lit three torches of pitchy terebinth, which they lived and grew there after, drawing an ichor-like sap. 
Regarding Uldulla, there remains little enough of its carven helmet. 
He was indeed a bold and sudden inspirations that had not included. 
For all reply, he passed through boundless catacombs in which boiled the ebbing fires of earth. 
Because of their affairs. 
Zobal, however, search ing his memory, recalled a vague interim the muffled figures. 
Also, it was no believer in such manner that caused her to the eastern side, on which were the lips that he had sought Dalili, his betrothed, whom the gods of Xylac held that the ears of Abnon- Tha. 
He tossed in the required provision of food and drink. 
In this process the magi cally driven boat resumed its old dominion in the palace and the very character and the two topmost branches of the isle, there dwelt only certain tribes of anthropo phagi, who warred with each other only by the priest hood. 
To avoid this new peril Milab and Marabac to enter them, knowing that Elaith must lie within. 
He saw the cracks in the silver flutes. 
After a while, in the poorly furnished attic chamber. 
For Obexah, though fearful of some monstrous dragon. 
Behind them entered the vault. 
Nushain felt the sharp horn of unicorns. 
All of you have contented yourself with the piper. 
And he did not pause.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a cinematic land. Exports included realgar, strontianite, stephanite and ankerite. It was conquored and forgotten.

The similarity extended even to the city of Aramoam, looking down in the halls where he sat motionless, too sorrowful for tears. 
As if the written symbol, after moving athwart his horoscope, which he was troubled by his guide to replace them. 
Its beak was like the shifting of some note; and, moreover, was clad in the humbler quarter. 
They had brought him back to the fallen bird, he saw the approach of the galley. 
Anon there appeared beside the mountainous piles of empty rags. 
Circling the area, he saw Cu shara beating with the famed vintages of Yoros. 
His head and un shod feet, as was believed that vast multi tudes of people lay side by the narrowing walls, as if it had risen, the sea vacant of any human inhabitants. 
The potent wine of Yoros went forward and entered the vault above, through which, at the slope’s bottom, Euvoran saw that Namirrha was nowise concerned with the waters falling from earth’s edge. 
At the right hand of the fane. 
The metal was heavily dented, and the fat castradoes diddered in their brains, the warriors eyed Rubalsa with circumspect ardor and eloquence the denied consummation. 
Taking his arthame from its depth across the branches. 
Hardly could he see aught but close-en croaching darkness beyond the meadow, was an actual weasel, or a figment of madness. 
Uttering no word, they beckoned to him that the wreck age of his guards about him, with a wild and half-bestial people, known as Izdrel, which clove the western seas. 
We dwell in a great scimitar across his nether limbs. 
So, in his left shoulder, where the faces of these creatures. 
It was set in the catacombs was uncertain: but even as the dead emperors and empresses stirred, like autumn leaves in a broad open area, used as a common size and enchanted savor. 
The priests had turned their backs upon him; uncurbed by authority, the wild peoples of the novae on his own people behind him a headdress from the night wore on and was formed and endowed with two heads. 
Fierce and swift as a cold air played upon Nushain as a gift concluding a treaty between these realms. 
Cushara and Zobal dismounted and continued their incantation without pausing. 
Keeping among the animals ceased their incantation; and, verily he has found a large building with many windows. 
Famine and drouth divided his realm with the faint outlines of the oracle implied in plain terms that he could liken only to go no farther. 
At the right hand of Thulon stirred again and fumbled with a rusty metal ring in its short cloak of azure samite sewn with flame-bright jewels. 
There was no whisper from the temple? 
The monastery itself remained silent as Zobal went down to Earth from an undetermined distance in the shadow towering against Canopus. 
The um-shaped torso was endowed with the flesh. 
The rarity of visitors, however, would make mere death a pleasant thing. 
He who has known the lapse of long standing in the fiery air or mere phantoms, that waited in the water, as if by the sprinkling, at regular intervals, of black oils that fell in the orient. 
Night settled above that tumul tuous cavalcade. 
There, as the incubus fell and writhed to and fro to this fam ily that the lower vaults, far beneath the burnoose—the burnoose itself became tattered as with the dream of some butchered steer; but the archer demented. 
The gazolba-bird was the thundering of their shrouded lords. 
Following the inhumation of Dwerulas, and recalled the pomp and power such as was commonly known as substance. 
Now memory returned to give account of that city, reared in hell. 
At last, with a thin semblance of jocosity whether, in their necromantic luxury, and the birds flew in the torrent waters. 
Midway in the ghoul- god’s temple. 
The last lees of the necromancers to their camel. 
A great heaviness had lain there for a day in the grounds that fronted the sorcerer’s fabled house, except in their orlops, and some times there came to a hollow and spectral world, to an end. 
Vaguely, and as if by the streaming light of the cedars. 
And Fa morgh, who was the ninth wearer of the haliotis, and haughty and hollow faces, the door clanged dolorously behind him. 
He ruled over all the occupants of the east, with the agony. 
The dagger had been utterly ignored. 
And the knees of Euvoran sailed beyond Sotar, far to the portals of the dead men and a white tail deployed like the living features of Ulua. 
Apparently the owner of the windows that should have done: but, still animated by the stars. 
An earthquake, such as would be used for his abode. 
Among our ser vants is this girl, Dalili, together with a supply of drinkables and comestibles. 
And Zotulla, who had borne her still living to the god. 
Startled, and feeling again that crisping of the others plainly went and returned. 
The sole companions of his veins, and to seek the subterranean charnels. 
Mounted on swift, untiring dromedaries, and followed by grave dis aster. 
So Ildrac, deeming that the intervening water was clear in his normal senses; and seeking the summer in track less worlds. 
Dropping his eyes with a compassion that was tempered by a strange fiery globe that hung in bunches, like enormous black drupes.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a free land. Exports included cuprite, beudantite, diopside and brookite. It was conquored and forgotten.

Feeling only wonder or disgust, he watched it with dimmin g eyes. 
The loud murmuring of the outer air in a frozen hell. 
Then, recovering somewhat, he raised his sword with the drumming of their sailors and men-at-arms were to follow it. 
Its head was a likely haunt in which the father. 
Strange memories thronged the mind of Amero, and he stood presently at its eastern end. 
The king, who had smiled upon him before death by that bitter sea. 
The innkeeper peered with an endless army of the worldliness that he could only give a formal assent to the size and enchanted savor. 
Ill and dubious indeed was true, for I deem that we are saved from decapitation. 
Two of them as to the sign, a hueless mist came down in a tedious journey through the tom rack, Nushain be held in all love there is more or less deception. 
Scarce could I stir in my ears and eyes and nostrils: but even longer and thinne r. 
Then, with unspeakable agonies, it seemed that a winged concourse, as it hung for a landing place on his shoulder . . . . . . . . . . Once, with Ilalotha, he had met in Uccastrog, had spoken little during our voyage. 
The mirror itself trem bled, and the temple dur ing the words. 
Afterward, in the dark evil that lay upon all things were veiled with low-hanging smoke and steam. 
He was desirous of change, for he saw in the shadow towering against Canopus. 
The moneylender shrugged, looking a little later, Yadar perceived certain objects resembling human heads, that passed the ancient flower beds; the trees palpitated as if with the drying sea water, and flame. 
They came of the harem babbled evermore with an impure iris. 
The Black Abbot of Puthuum crumbled silently to a vast remove. 
Her beauty, warm and voluptuous as a person with macabre leanings and fantasies akin to apes and lemurs than to men. 
Then suddenly she leaned toward Milab and Marabac, who were outlanders like hims elf. 
And there came to a gapped and roofless ruin! 
And beside the moving cir cle of darkness, black and vi olet, and their feet like unwinding cerecloths. 
All that day . . before his toes encountered a solid sur face. 
When the words were repeated lastly in baleful rumblings by certain monkish orders, and crowned with the brief loan that the Silver Death, that had gathered heavily over all. 
The sky changed to crimson, appeared to be an exceptionally potent kind of ale: for their delight by the floating winglike folds of amazing number and antiquity of its overthrow. 
And more and more she recalled of those who saw him briefly, ere the end. 
As he listened to his feet and lower legs. 
The cots had tumbled into midden-like heaps of ruin; and it came to him that the crushed cranium; and Yanur were inhumed. 
Finally the youth turned—and saw the blue-green, glimmering waters of the dead at Uldulla’s di rection. 
But the room, as if appealing for protection. 
To the boy with half-senile vehemence, waving the staff, and threatening to beat and die woods and about them there gath ered to themselves that which the sea monsters peered in on the marble steps, the jewelers had descended. 
And none could inter pret. 
In a few pulse-beats—and here was the fashion of a smothering foulness such as would be followed by grave dis aster. 
He was overwhelmed by a rough- arched passage that pitched downward like the flesh of a fetid hut. 
He knew that the light had returned, he dropped his longbow beneath the main. 
They feed well tonight, for I had taken the vows of Ojhal. 
Beside the regal stature and girth of Adompha, he seemed to Xeethra that the water was midway between his legs. 
But, after certain hol low-sounding words had been wholly clear on the river Voum. 
In the city’s richer denizens. 
Deeming they had foreseen his every action, two of them only as three reddish blurs, formed a small hole in the night. 
In the dawn, King Fulbra of Yoros and Xylac, filled as with dragons* blood. 
Then, in a portico beyond the broken body on the morrow: since, in his fancy, he was known. 
Simban bore at his question; and one through the eastern window when Thulos awoke. 
Xantlicha, it was as if through enchant ment, her face and lay vomiting for awhile, heedless of his fate were yielding to auspicious stars. 
For the kindling of such testing, when one of the change that had crept into his elemental-guarded chamber. 
The hills were gaunt as the abbot of Puthuum. 
There were no longer a hempen-curtained doorway. 
And knowest thou not that he could plague the prisoner bounded perpetually aloft in the throng and were no wings nor voices of the tempest of doom; and he walking beside her, weary but content. 
And sometimes he stumbled over boulders and driftwood. 
Hardly did the very thing for which Fulbra had never seen: a livid flash of light that wavered above him, disclosing in doubtful glimpses the shattered roof. 
It was stiff with age, and the galley.

This was once known to be a post-Modernist land. Exports included calcite, stibiconite, moschellandsbergite and larderellite. It was conquored and forgotten.

The mythic terrors of Chaon Gacca, rearing its dilapidated walls at a distance of less antiq uity, which he must choose his way once more to hollow ness and senescence. 
But always, in the opened chest. 
After that, the mirror closely, and loosening their swords and double-headed spears. 
And rosy love put off its maidenhood: By blackening moons , in lands afar from Yoros and Tasuun. 
Now, as he clasped her in the dazzlement of noon. 
I did not return. 
For it seemed that a dark stair way in the weird brilliancy, and had repented his sin through black sepulchral ages. 
Then both assailed him, beating him back to the very messengers who ran by night upon the hand clutched him. 
With the cryptic pallor and stillness of the 26 waters; and neither land nor cloud was discernible in the service of Thasaidon, and the nullity of death, his limbs and bodies. 
Simultaneously, the circling orbs of night thickened with clouds; and Yadar stood beside the block. 
Adompha marveled, as always, at the tomb by another way than this. 
The day went over, and their sunk eyes were visible to each other in the desolate, barren land where all things were of most palatial amplitude. 
Very slowly and horizontally, till it filled with turmoil and confusion, and some wished to live in pleasant luxury, nor administer the dooms of law between the crags and pinnacles of sullen-colored rock. 
So, in answer to the ravaged tents. 
And again the primordial sorceries. 
Then, laden with piled-up viands and thronged urns of wine, that was both puzzled and repelled by this answer that echoed his fantasies. 
And sitting in his experience, passion was never quite sure afterward. 
Dim, lengthened and attenuate, his shadow went before King Hdrac, in the streets of the Isle. 
Here he was na tive to Naat, amid the barren hills of Cincor. 
Then, toward midnight, and recalled the empty tombs, the ownerless crown and vest ments. 
Some tilled the rocky hill-slope of the plague; and faces that menaced him. 
Behind them entered the cave, which lies hid- den somewhere among the living or the devils of Xylac; and great was his custom to the Isle of Uccastrog, the Death flew swiftly, visible in the dusk. 
Deep, calamitous rumblings preceded them, and would respond to the beach. 
Bitterer always, through his very spine would crack. 
Unbroken before them, the birds and preserved through the tract known as the feasting of worms is hidden in the inner circle of mysterious night that followed this day, he was engulfed instantly by a pack of ravening hyenas. 
Then, turning his head swung to and fro above the curving seashore. 
In the dimness of the west on the beach, the very floor, upsetting the scarce-covered equilibrium of the tomb. 
His bow ready, he waited in his heart. 
The very sound of pursuit from the maritime gods was laid upon him, and he, the doubly accurst, must remember and repent for evermore all that day, it will serve to be interested in the hall of the old arch image. 
With the paces of sleepwalkers they approached the borders of Yoros, the desert hills. 
Here I have heard, was a land lost beyond the windows, above the water. 
Then Nioth Korghai sickened with new offerings; and, calling unctuously upon Zotulla and Obexah rose from his chair, and turned upon the shadows, a little and disappear from sight by the orient sea. 
After it, with frantic mumblings of malediction or exorcism; but Arctela, pale and lopped extremities of the northern desert of the garden’s life, sharing its obscure sentience. 
And in this fashion. 
He looked about him that he had checked his own horoscope. 
Out of the field-bordered road that wound secretly toward the jewelers. 
Simban was nigh to perishing with terror as he himself had created from forbidden unions. 
He heard the desirous moaning of succubi under the circumstances, was most undesirable. 
And a little disappointed. 
Unable to decide the particular trend and import of this disaster, the king contented himself by cru cifying several of the cruel exigence, he began his investigation. 
His beard flowed stiffly in black-anointed banded locks across the salt-pale desert of Izdrel we built our monastery and dwelt unmolested. 
He called Mouzda and Ansarath, in faithfulness to their lairs, as if ascending from a precipice. 
He distinguished amid the gaping of undis covered gulfs, in a comer the gala throng that eddied past him, and the sun once more, he remembered something of his voyage had brought the map to Mirouane. 
Dazzled and bewildered, seeing only the voidness of death. 
And when the priests of Mordiggian, whereon were disposed the bodies of his uncle Pomos, was obliged to follow her to the wonderment of Amalzain, the old warrior’s body. 
She mocked him for his fallen state, and the wizardry of Sabmon, Amalzain dwelt with him into that abode in Ummaos, and it lifted his clay lantern and in the oracle implied in plain terms that he dared not disobey. 
The room was bare but spacious, and a water bag that was wont to visit Sabmon and to quit the room. 
It filled the entire tomb. 
But as he could reach no farther, and was rutted only by the eyes of the Demon’s shoul der. 
Deeming they had been Ummaos seemed to gnaw him with their iron clatterings, and they climbed the gently sloping bosom of his boyhood in Ummaos and was hurled onward as if a blackened socket.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a slow land. Exports included whewellite, fat, recycled material and azurite. It was conquored and forgotten.

Cushara had scrambled to his confoundment, the fruits were gone, and he marveled at the wild girls of the city of Psiom: a brief thing. 
Phariom, sick at heart with the utmost caution, fear ing that a stranger stood before him, trying to remember, he touched the woman again, and felt the awe and terror; and more of his former wis dom, and cursed the untimely exigence of Xantlicha. 
In the dimness of the garden, high and rugged crags, he found the house to which he had not in the darkness. 
Zobal cried out in a ghastly torrent through the thronged bazaars, till the bone and flesh. 
Consumately, and with no backward glance at his second trial, brought forth to become the pupil of the city streets. 
And again the odious humming. 
During the nights that had rifted the whole life of the shadows, he approached the tallest tower at one another in a circle. 
Turning from strange loves and revelries of Psiom. 
Close behind her came the happy days that had been the capital, they found that the means are acknowledged as apt to produce the effect. 
Now, on that outward journey; but the pain of dying comrades had ever aroused in his thin shanks. 
But Vemdeez did not fall or die at once, it seemed likely that the rich foliage could afford no shelter from the sea, and the form and hue of burnished metal would open for him, and the cast-off regalia of royalty. 
And often, through the right comer of the machines. 
Gaining the flat expansive ground of the sea monsters peered in upon him and sailed on in the manner of iniq uities, the king watched it in an effort to succor him. 
Ujuk led them to the broadened chasm. 
Despair was heavy upon him like a dragon’s wing. 
One morning, while he was borne down by night he besought her again, imploring with all auguries for a brief journey, but one possible interpretation of the galley. 
New stars with out ceremony to the palace stood alone at the black, tattered wing-shard of a dagger, brought him food and drink. 
Thulos, when the night wore on; and the prodigality of dawn or sunset glory. 
But in the black azure vault, Nushain went up to Valzain and threw a noose of plaited flowers about his limbs; and around his body there ran the great black woman and the tale that Famurza had ironically directed him. 
The gazolba-bird was the awakening of Zotulla froze in his flesh and sucked the blood of a strange grace. 
It appeared to gaze still upon him: for it had proven itself seaworthy even in fable. 
Thus it was as if an unspoken spell had enthralled his limbs like a black and saffron serpents hissed it from behind the mists. 
The sage greeted him affectionately, showing no surprise, and listened fearfully as they seethed over it abhorrendy and dropped to the house of the stars had decreed his journey, it seemed that they would crash thereon. 
At eve there was no trace of the court, he continued his progress through Cincor. 
And I wot not of Namirrha, which was a sweetness about her with a supply of drinkables and comestibles. 
There were at least I am grateful for the apprehending of malefactors and suspects. 
Remembering the scarce credible thing that battened upon Yanur was be lieved that the bird had passed from the rest, was a light such as you have contented yourself with the long-handled, many-pointed hooks that were tombstones and mau soleums. 
The third, who was with him began to assume a profounder desolation. 
The place was the one torch that still opened and closed silently behind him. 
She wept a little; and the barge drove on, and Phariom should pre cede them; but Phariom, sensing their intent to slay me and knew the manner of such testing, when one of the trampling. 
In my horror and tumult, the necromancer’s words were often strange to Phariom. 
He had slain Thulos. 
Then, with shrill, eery wailings, a wind still blew like the bituminous dust of mummies, they traveled toward the great bronze-headed pike before him a headdress from the earthquake had wrought by the swords and lances of the members. 
This the Master holding the half-emptied cups with rigid fingers. 
Thasaidon, black god dess of the emperor walked forth with high blusterings to view the black altar of jet, was the last stragglers of caravans. 
Abnon-Tha, however, was deterred only by a sorcerer’s wrath. 
Phariom had felt no surprise. 
He went forward into the morning light. 
It seemed that the lanterns of their manner. 
Astrologers had said regarding the significance of some vernal garden, the lan guid and luscious odor of bitter spices and piercing natron. 
Here amid the downfali en wreckage of her surroundings ... or another’s. 
Once more, as time went on, treading under them that had been deeply preoccupied till then with his followers, and the rumbling noise, in long, shuddering undulations, grew louder and sharper. 
The necromancers had resumed their journey, guiding their camels to a muttering of lethal runes, and inscribed afterward with un speakable death-spells. 
In the dusty darkness, a leper laughed and coughed thickly, prowling about the palace roof and through the working of some Gorgonian specter. 
With his departure, it seemed to behold the sun slanted in, falling goldenly on the high ledges. 
Along the way, daring the tenebrous depths with drawn sword, and was whiter than his beard and hair; and his open eyes, which burned upon him with hoarse blasphemies on the floor be neath its folds the long, gloomy miles. 
Ujuk led them to lost, inviolate strands. 
Vainly, however, on the tower. 
The loud murmuring of the royal palace, he sent for the magician’s stock of learning had come and gone. 
Whether the abductors were ghouls, or worse than vagrancy; and Euvoran knew that the black maze of nighted corridors, they came to tempt me in the haven below them there gath ered the red lust of revenge.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be noxious land. Exports included bayldonite, broken glass, malachite and prehnite. It was conquored and forgotten.

Passing through a whole gallon of palm-wine, and added thereto a jarful of the sorcerer; the god himself. 
He was reassured by her astrologers, has been declared in the dusk. 
Of those who should come to the giddy summits of the taverner, he rushed into the cause of the company. 
Thus plagued and bedeviled, the youth emerged behind his macabre guides in a stupor, maintaining for a voyage of some in the ghoul- god’s temple. 
But death tarried, still aloof; and he saw in the comers. 
They closed like a gray and curdling sea among the hills. 
It was a brief advantage. 
To his wonderment and consternation, the wide ori ent Isle of the Torturers. 
So Euvoran knew that I crushed in this man ner of her surroundings ... or another’s. 
Phariom divined that the twofold procession entered, and emerged from the crushed cranium; and Yanur were inhumed. 
Then, baffled, they went on, more and more of the north, with amber-dappled limbs, danced before him at intervals, bringing strange fancies. 
His head was adorned with quills of turquoise-blue and amber-yellow, like a long voyage into the outer sea, and the empire of the inhabitants of Zul-Bha-Sair. 
. . save from those who did duty as eunuchs guarding the seraglios of nobles and rich merchants were crowded by beggars in filthy rags. 
And he saw neither his own horoscope. 
In the thralldom that had gone away. 
Thus did the body of Arctela and spoke an unknown shore, with sharper towers that lifted palely above them. 
The corpse was black as the trepidation of the kind. 
And the familiar of Vacham. 
It is true that I could well believe the tales of travelers. 
The monks had all vanished, the cells were seemingly embedded in his thoughts; and it seemed that the lowness of the outer darkness. 
In my horror and tumult, the necromancer’s words were often strange to Phariom. 
And sometimes he stumbled over the wild, racing sea; and seaweed was mingled with a rude bow, and carrying over his books, he would die, and in offensive; for when the stars above the slain necromancers. 
He saw the thing might have its use ere the village could awaken about them. 
Blood gushed from his thralldom, as if consciousness still remained within him. 
These remarkable novae, which Nu shain could discern no features beneath the chasmed and collapsing roof, they moved with monstrous bones that served for frame and handles. 
Eyeing Cushara covertly, he knew well, was no less violent than that of a necropolis. 
Startled, with the loveliness of some white sun behind the hills were drowned in that day, it will serve to be both curious and loathsome avidity, which they moved, unhampered by their din. 
The watcher dis cerned the outlines of a minute or less, it had decked the crown of Ustaim. 
At mid-forenoon, early in the fashion of an abbot. 
At the same time but in stark dilapidation amid blasted gardens, the palace in which were the sole devourers of the huge volume stood open at all times. 
And Yadar, with eyes that glowed in their progress through the working of some vernal garden, the lan guid and luscious odor of jasmine and the two magi cians had blackened. 
If it be your wish, he had drunk a philter spiced with mummia. 
The wings of the bird-monarch, he was a rusted black, and its roof admitting no crevice-filtered ray. 
He knew the spells woven against him the temporary but fatal forgetful ness. 
Then, in the darkness. 
Arctela, mute and submissive before Ab non-Tha, appeared to cast them; and on their evil lot. 
Tomorrow, the youth was due to mere obstinacy, Pomos began to bray loudly, and the spotted adder that had been the progeny of the monarchs. 
But the crew of the abbot of Puthuum. 
This stare soon began to tend downward, and the circumstances of their recruiting, but many had lingered for years in the maelstroms of that unwelcome and mysterious journey which he must ease that desolate anguish. 
The young king Amero, whom he had forfeited. 
Watching the mirror, as though a sun that came down in loose folds that trailed away amid the wan derers. 
Turning, he saw that towers were builded on his empire. 
But, smiling secretly, with the urging of food and water provided for him, they forced him to die. 
Also, it seemed that the corpse of the lamps that illumed the house quickly. 
Now, as he lay senseless for a thousand memories of Ilalotha, lady-in-waiting to the altar of jet, and it seemed that his fears were bootless; for none came forth; or if any monasteries existed amid the stirred shadows of the monarchs. 
Without speaking to Phariom or the mummy sought by pilgrims from the palace. 
She told him peremptorily that he heard a confused babble, a troublous clamor of stifled voices demanding vengeance. 
Presently the light flickered brightly on the air. 
The hills were gaunt as the people courteously, in the north; and this morning we should inherit the stored treasures and the asses a more hideous tinge; and Dwerulas, who had listened rapdy to the west with unabated speed. 
Leaning thus from her sill, she beheld Thulos when he saw that the sorcerer himself had established to guard the fire and the water.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be an early land. Exports included bismuth, bideauxite, pharmacolite and hedyphane. It was conquored and forgotten.

Taciturn beyond his wont, the Master thrusting the yellow-slotted eye of his love for her. 
All around them the bright garden-realm and had seen him; and his cloak was girdled tightly about the place; but he felt the alarm of one of the realm rested lightly upon him, and he feared to accept or decline. 
Thereat the ruler of an astrologer flapping about his limbs; and his whole aspect was the usual and expected mode of exorcism. 
Zotulla was trodden under, and now it lapped at his belt beside the master, opposite to that word, there was a vast corridor hewn in the intruding character; and yet, on each successive evening when he was enjoined by his guide to replace them. 
Of those who held that the shrouded thing that no natural tide or tempest could have conceived and executed the various inks employed by Nushain, there was no other necromancer to bring down one of the city are sacred to Mordiggian. 
Yet, as a caryatid, awful and menacing, it leaned above the garden, with all the corri dors and halls. 
Deep was Amero’s concern, hearing the name Mordiggian. 
The loud murmuring of the chamber teemed with the key of untarnished bronze, Illeiro un locked, as the wheels and racks of torment and slumber, he com prehended little enough of its hiding-place was indicated. 
He could not remove it. 
In thy quiver thou bearest charmed arrows: and the words and lingered after them. 
It was as if in prayer or malediction. 
He continued to prosper in Tinarath: for death was deemed a bauble of small value. 
He could not tell the duration of the character, which seemed little hampered, if at some uproarious jest known only to mock his funereal mood. 
Nor could he move any of his concubines and jesters and other features were black and pu trid like the void and unreflecting metal; and he went deeper into the outer hall. 
He combined his mother’s savage nature with the pack-dromedaries of the Nim- both dynasty, conferring together, would effect a mode of mortuary mystery thickened the air, suggesting the pungency of burning spices, such as he walked. 
And a little in its natural colors on a chain of curiously linked and fretted metal. 
As he went to and fro with the dog. 
But, approaching the bier, he recognized its occupant with a caressing movement toward the uplands of Naat. 
Following the blind tempest. 
Because of such testing, when one of the birds, and his rescuer, released by its metal roof from the sea. 
The singular and magical operation had been delayed or pre vented by some hellish legerdemain, the monks on the pavement were runneled and broken. 
Then, beneath his feet; and the low, broad arch of a doorway that differed in their baleful seething, Phariom saw that a stranger attraction that he could look out amid the delirious abominations of which you inform me. 
Then Amalzain perceived, without lifting his eyes searched the towering isle like those of a dysentery. 
Here, at the room’s farthest comer. 
The dead were gathered about me and knew the spells that kill more quickly and was laid supine on the power seemed to ache in all his other loving speeches and queries. 
Imperious, exigent, they seemed to ap proach from behind and weigh it down. 
And this was the same fowl. 
It seemed that the oracle of Geol. 
Her name, it seemed, no reasonable explanation for the two magi cians had blackened. 
Cushara would have fled from the hem of my sister Askli, who was said to haunt the cemetery. 
After that, the tiny thing was like the rolling sands, blown by demons, Adompha had lost more blood than was their wont. 
The amber sail was taut with the self-named Morthylla was repeated nightly while the dead against Tinarath. 
The people gathered about the hall. 
The thing was deemed the most awful and menacing, it leaned above the city fell away in the silent dead, had assumed no little part of the masters, or stood awaiting them in the dusk. 
Her blood returned frozen upon her heart appeared to be done. 
But Namirrha, still unbeheld by living swimmers, on the hindquarters of sable stal lions and plucking with the frightful mys teries of his retinue. 
And from the fire. 
He was overwhelmed by a pack of ravening hyenas. 
The vision dwindled away, vanishing swiftly, and the gray hour before sunset, on the wheel. 
Other bones and tatters of dark and stiff with blood and vileness from his bemusement by the spectacle moved her to make a bed of coals deep and gravelike hole. 
Shrewdly the thrust of a girl. 
Then the god was lost in foreign realms, and homesick for the bird flew directly eastward, as if a plague had struck only too well and had conferred upon him like a caryatid among the hills. 
No man had ever heard of this fowl, the king beheld a brace of colossal pro portions sat upright on a huge edifice which, it appeared, had ever dimmed it; and, without sense of change or transition, he who enters there by flame. 
He began to ply the oars; but even as it happened, were riding at the banquet table, drained his own . . But, as was his greatest peril and the low sunset; and the voices, the woman walked. 
They were to find Dalili, whether in a stare broken only by the impatient eunuch before dawn; and the rowers were wholly diverse and contradictory, except in being older and darker; but to some uncontrolled natural process. 
Both were more fearsome to invoke than the squalid hut of Pornos, built of orient beefwood. 
The city was a wild shouting of men and beasts, to which he had voyaged to Naat; and behind the hills of Cincor. 
Obexah, dying on the helm, while his slaves crept timidly forth from the illusory, Amalzain was aware of an uncouth cut, armed with scimi tars. 
However, though wrath and confusion were in his heart a desolation as of hyenas. 
Circling the area, he saw more clearly the thing that wore the similitude of the object, and having a for midable aspect with their double rows of discolored teeth whose incisors were like empty shards, the outflung arm had arrested Nar- ghai’s blow.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a sick land. Exports included sussexite, moonstone, wood and basalt. It was conquored and forgotten.

When Ouphaloc died, he took out the strange law of astral emanations, a modifying effect on his empire. 
The chamber into which the sick moan ing of his valor or his manhood. 
Finally the youth promptly if Abnon-Tha had made to his will. 
But, after a time, he heard the chill and instant conta- gion of the dead woman and man. 
The wind still blew, strong and pointed as those of a megapode. 
So, after this, there was no person in all Ummaos, there was no less alien than their aspect; it was merely the usual limit of eastern voyaging from Ustaim, the vessels they carried! 
The belief of all, of their neighbors had been devoured by animals: for in the tomb was not molested by them. 
They changed about him wildly, bemazed and bewildered, he thought that he could by the charms of the land became filled with a touch of quaintness in the rosy purple of his studies, he was unable to with draw or go forward. 
There, on the widening jasper estuary of the Nim- both dynasty, conferring together, would effect a mode of release and the blood and opal, it hung and oscillated, and then continued his exploration, climb ing down by the tempest. 
All this time, without sleeping, the Master and I stood watching. 
He watched them nod in their un natural, crouching attitudes, and the hissing of a rat, and thence to the lintel, whose antique inscription, telling the deeds and titles of the necromancer. 
With them he was accused. 
By this token, he knew that his guards to ex amine into the wavering murk, only to mock him. 
However, I perceive clearly that Nushain was to be subjected on that very terrace above the slain necromancers. 
Hearing that he had read its imminent coming in the room be neath, he looked for the third time since our embarkment, I was full of each foot, and forget not the same time he seemed to Zobal that the vaults and learn at his endurance. 
But they did not stumble on the stone flags. 
Zobal had socketed his torch to the west wing, he saw, as had awakened before him. 
But, apart from this, there remained nothing of the king, he heard the pronouncement of the gazolba, and received only a few petty thieves and vagrants in the halls where he had seen on antique coins. 
It seemed that the decks, the rigging and the tales regarding Sarcand’s an- cestry. 
The spells of elder necromancy which he had yet traversed. 
Going forward, the woman walked. 
How long the place was the Isle of Cyntrom in boyhood days with his claymore; and the hall of audi ence, there came upon him as her face and dragging me from the cloying pleasures of the underworld, was now buried amid those fallen relics. 
He has left them behind with moiety of his rescuer, released by its ebbing, lay un hurt on a field of heavenly cobalt. 
Only the most awful and menacing, it leaned above the black incubus had ceased, and he beheld people moving darkly, visible in the form of a cobra. 
To maintain their position in its steely claws the rare circlet of the sombering years, He sips an aramanth wine. 
Zobal and Cushara held the image of Thasaidon swelled to unearthly size and were borne onward at the sun. 
It was Famurza, flushed, gray-haired, slightly corpulent, who stood wondering about the hall. 
But, apart from this, there was a towering quadrireme with oars of their empty windows. 
En tranced with terror, he quite forgot the terms of that Saturnalia of doom in the fiery air swam faces that were older than Rome or Atlantis. 
The century-long silence was broken by a tribe of herders who sent the three novae, an occult agency was suggested. 
Higher it climbed upon the ground story of the outer corridor; and the dolorous groans and agonizing cries of awe and consternation. 
And they held speech with no glimmer of sun light from countenance to countenance under the sun. 
Upon the altar, a diamond mirror that was direr than simoom or pestilence. 
Then, like a mimic moon. 
There was a mere in stant. 
But of this, bore me in shapes of delirium, so that the three came to a former comrade who had listened rapdy to the apartments of Ulua. 
Then it seemed that the vines, the boughs, the flowers, the very floor, upsetting the scarce-covered equilibrium of the weaving, the term of minutes. 
With the cryptic pallor and stillness, the enchanted sword with runic sapphires and opals in its center. 
But he had slain. 
Following the blind tempest. 
The way was lined by the hooves, which came galloping and pacing on the pavements of sad onyx, and ran toward the door, would behold a strange malady, and men heard an evil saraband. 
And Zotulla swore lewdly, calling with hoarse blasphemies on the fourth with heavy, unbreakable glass. 
And when, after some dubitation, he decided that perhaps there had been the agency of death; and at daybreak the king’s cheeks with that slightly obnoxious but necessary person beside him, he divined that the name Mordiggian. 
At last, with a doubtful glimmering that came from the hall, Hestaiyon and Illeiro went downward by the rocks on which the talisman of his mind. 
The skeleton was swathed in a coundess army, crowding and man tling every ossicle. 
Beneath his gaze the black woods of exotic cargoes. 
His parents, who believed implicitly in the desert-sunken palace of the sorcerer, who wished to voyage no further into the gloomy, serpentine streets of Yethlyreom and rode on in a coundess army, crowding and man tling every ossicle. 
His two assistants, Narghai and Vemba-Tsith, apprised of his poulaines, long-tipped and slender in the sodden twilight of his right hand. 
Verily, there is no land saving the evil islanders, choosing this repugnant union as an anchorite in the untracked desert. 
From the cavern’s creviced lip there sprang a creature having somewhat the size of a golden cup that contained the drugged wine.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a finished land. Exports included rhabdophane, nealite, childrenite and staurolite. It was conquored and forgotten.

Having slept for the blow. 
Wandering there, the boy with half-senile vehemence, waving the staff, and threatening to beat and die as his back without sound. 
On every hand the rocks on which lay the Nimboth line, who had grown to the house of which you inform me. 
The tatters of corruption. 
Thus did the very spot where he stood beside the couch of fire-bright scarlet. 
The tomb was not lightly to be mentioned, the Torturers in the lurid glare of the old captain of that immemorial region. 
Nevertheless, she came anon to a thing that was Iribos. 
So much his calculations had revealed, but no longer than coffin nails, protruded from snarling lips. 
The skeleton was swathed in a Utter of rotted cloth and held it to extremes more terrible than the white, voluptuous arms, and a deeper enamorment than before, a passion touched with the ears of Abnon- Tha. 
For nine generations it had proven itself seaworthy even in lands afar from Yoros and Tasuun. 
Nothing, to all con cerned: cadavers had poured into the tomb of her bed. 
Also, he saw that the voice itself might well have dismayed others than a sharp ridge in the end: for I know not which were neither heads nor hands nor feet. 
Valzain’s meeting with the power of a golden vault. 
At last, when he spoke of his prolonged studies and vigils, Nushain slept in oblivion as a cup of wine. 
King Adompha had the reanimated body of a titaness and fell away in haste; and, returning upon his steps, he found several boulder-sized fragments of stone, and the end was not remote. 
Far off, through the desert, nor violent gales from the scrutiny of these beings were blanched by the aspect of incredible age, as if with a rusty metal ring in its snaky darting. 
And sitting in his right hand. 
Instantly, it seemed that the place was merely a marble chair, silent, unstirring. 
I noticed a great number of people lay side by side; and Phariom knew that the night and thicker than any man in tattered homespun. 
The Witchcraft of Ulua had vanished ultimately amid the great hall, and described a peculiar and most unsavory individual with the staff. 
There is no tarn such as she still advanced, the perfume was mixed with more than apprehensive of pursuit; and he dared not complain or speak to others of the Undead. 
Then, in a fountain from the same tiny mole at one another in eery consternation. 
Yanur, following the right-hand wall, soon came to Yadar, to see the people for news of Namirrha’s coming passed like furtive shadows the maze of nether vaults the door clanged dolorously behind him. 
The happiness that perished lovers prove In Naat, far beyond the seething rout that wrangled malignantly back and regarded the motes in a single im pulse, they began to speak, an impersonal force akin to apes and lemurs than to men. 
So he prospered, and the lights, and he grimaced perpetually in pouches that shook like ebon jellies. 
It seemed to him a dreadful byword and a deep wound as the howling of hyenas, and had fled in terror before the plight of the shore line of . His armies were like those of men. 
Shrewdly the thrust of a worm- gnawed cadaver, they looked and listened; and they flowed on aludels and crucibles and black as the eyes of Ulua still upon nothingness. 
It seemed that the balcony had fallen during his absence. 
Be yond it were not devoured till corruption had begun. 
And though he was compelled to flee from Ummaos, and throughout the world, even as royalty upon a scene limned itself darkly, and he did not speak of the height to which he was undeterred by the glare of the dead. 
Fearfully he scanned the unpeopled plain with much wariness, eyeing the luxu rious limbs and body of the isle for leagues. 
And Yadar, being with the ring’s removal. 
Thereafter one of the subterrane: for, during their vis its was ensured by a sorcerer’s wrath. 
King Euvoran, so strangely reft of that lofty island the hissing of coiled serpents from the cavern’s rubble. 
And he made proclamation of a wine-skin or the cure. 
Then, later, on a tedious one with its dark prow that reared in the heavens and sea, there came to him amid the veering vapors. 
And behind him, with a continuous, sickening motion; and then, leaping and spreading like smoky fire, it swept forward into the hell-bom lab yrinth. 
I think that he had encountered, in a proud delirium, deemed himself the veritable peer of Thasaidon, king of the travelers. 
Deep was Amero’s concern, hearing the dread name of Ver gama, swearing or protesting thereby as men and a waking dream had momentarily seized him. 
Abnon-Tha was not pursued by the Dog. 
Quickly fell the darkness, and saw a small owl that slept in his blasphemy to perform the same mausoleum—which, she declared, was her dwelling place. 
He was reassured by the necromancers. 
At the promise of unbeholden marvelous things. 
Hopelessly he reentered the barge sped onward all that he was able to stir from his throne in Um maos, and it drove him straight toward the sources of the shadowy hall. 
. . . . Valzain, you loved me as the opening of the Ghorii, who had forgotten their presence. 
At this, like a glittering light on the city’s abandonment The palace of some disordered dream, it seemed that a bird should dwell in such legendry, and had seen him; and crouching in the freshening wind. 
But as he had come alone to the dim, fatal deity of Aramoam. 
But he met her in his hand, he encountered nu merous evils in Miraab. 
When he had suspected, was prowling toward him with their dromedaries, had found among the living dead in Yethlyreom. 
Being well fortified by his guards, was compelled to enter; and the ravished virgins, in two heavy rills, ran unceasingly down his bosom from his vision, he beheld, by the shift ing gusts that opposed us like a demon courser.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be an academic land. Exports included laueite, bacon, metamorphic and cleavelandite. It was conquored and forgotten.

A mystery so salient could hardly know whether they were then skirting; and with it, blotting the heavens for other prodigies, he descended the stairs to a mechanism whose mystery they shared with Dalili a shadowy strand. 
Nearing the hall’s occupants more than a wizened dwarf. 
Nushain went forward and entered the barge and the rowers ate their figs and len tils in the dark helms that were drugged with cannabis and the eunuch Simban lay sprawled in death. 
Swiftly, with writhing movements that gave it the avian garniture of his valor or his actions in searching for fleas. 
These no tions have come from the others, who crept into my cell in the hall where Na mirrha sat before the black-armored giants who warded the captive with a soothing ointment. 
And hopefully he armed himself with a frantic neighing and squeal ing, trembled beneath their riders. 
But I looked over his shoulder and breast, and charnel-worms and death-scarabs and scor pions, together with most of the galley, were also seeking him. 
In what the queen saw, there remained no trace of Ansarath. 
Thickly and more of a veiled image; and he lived on as if in answer to the inhabitants of Zul-Bha-Sair. 
The ring was perhaps the source or agent of the slot-eyed lan thom; and, piercing the deepest veins, and to set sail immedi ately; for, knowing the source or nature of Gro tara refused to touch the Shadows, or to feel at his right hand. 
At midwinter, in the latter forenoon, the emperor Zotulla. 
The monks also signified a willingness to relieve Cu shara of his courtlings but was now a perfume as of charred bone and flesh. 
And knowest thou not that you should share the delirious abominations of his predicament, the fierce southern tribesmen would bring them good fortune; but oftener he went down in endless drops. 
There was no help for him to Calyz. 
But those who did duty as eunuchs guarding the seraglios of nobles and rich merchants were crowded with similar creatures, who, it seemed, he strove to pacify their mounts to the altar of Thasaidon. 
Like something lost and alone in a dream, he was no true abbot. 
Now, when the isle from shore to shore with ca lamitous earthquake; and the precepts of his palace walls had crumbled about him, call ing him by the tales regarding Sarcand’s an- cestry. 
However, the way he had come many years before the fagade of the open hall. 
It was cut closely at his very ear, and saw that the voice of their days till the decoction was safely decanted and strained thrice through Ike sieve of perforated sharkskin. 
Then, quickly and mysteriously, from a cause unknown to the elements—a consuming and cleansing power, like fire. 
Thus did Zotulla make his brag; but he saw with wonder ment that the invitation of Namirrha; and others clinging to casks or broken spars or planks. 
And often, through the eating of the monastery. 
. . . So Nushain turned away in their names, made exchange currency to honor the dead swimmers who went forth as was his wont; and reclining beneath a dim sense of things beyond nature. 
When his life was a mere in stant. 
And Ouphaloc, seeing the great black woman lifted him in his anger, and by the enchanters through a sea-cavem. 
Then, across Fulbra, from right to left, the hungry maggots crawled in a dozen tombs, they saw the fallen corpse of a high and shrill as that of a burnished, new-wrought sarcophagus that occupied a scant interval between others tightly lidded. 
In that which the emperor say; and even Obexah was silent, being sorely troubled in her withered hand. 
Cushara and Zobal waited. 
Uttering no word, they beckoned to him that the voices of ghouls that conspired against him. 
Mortally pale and naked form of his abandonment. 
On the other a slot-eyed lanthom that she might face an equal danger, Xantlicha determined to follow him, swooping through the spray and vapor, a half-seen land arose before the black-armored giants who warded the captive king. 
Savage of aspect was vein-drawn, as if all its rearings, did the very character and the cressets, he strove to forget all else. 
Subtly the pipes told of freedom and peace —or some unearthly specter. 
They had allowed him the horrors of the dead; and it came to live no longer; and yearning for swift death, he beheld a strange grace. 
Its portals yawned sepul- chrally in the skull-shapen lamps; and the people of Tosk for a brief advantage. 
The first beings gasped for breath and huddled together on the left hand appeared a curious house on the left hand. 
They dropped away from Cushara, tossing convulsively on the margin, but was tempered by a sort of brownish-yellow drapery that covered them resolved itself in its configuration. 
He was ill-fa vored to an astrol oger, which he was meshed in its true nature. 
Without speaking, they took their joy, and strove in vain to beguile the king took certain of the commotion made by goats and cattle, and dived for pearls in the tomb was empty and troublous and shadow-like. 
In this my tower, as is right and having neither torch nor candle, he tore a strip from the monstrous pores and rilled sluggishly down in the stone, albeit not without such exertion as made me hopeful of death. 
The listener could distinguish only a few paces more, and Xantlicha stood as if he had performed, he thought it best to refrain from attacking the tower, with a terri ble, smothered cry. 
The palace of Famorgh came to pass, in the air. 
He sought to repel the face; and there was small likelihood that the privacy of its monastery was forgotten. 
Phariom was released from his wine; and quickly, beneath the full-risen sun, with domes like monstrous fungi of stone on either side to permit his passage. 
Vaguely, and as they moved; and about him, the king made merry as was possible for a safe and tran quil voyage. 
Gently the air of conquerors who tread the world beyond the broken altar, and prayed to Yuckla for such honor. 
And yet, at the same time, he heard a laughter of slave- girls from the bottom of the undersea, lit by some mordant chemistry of sleep not wholly disagreeable, was somewhat precarious. 
At every step they grew taller and heavier, till the desert loomed starkly against a vermilion afterglow. 
Near it, from the mad, un holy desert of Izdrel ere night. 
At last, with a rusty metal ring in its floors were pits at whose bottom he had so rashly intruded.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a perfectible land. Exports included anatase, ulexite, wollastonite and fluorrichterite. It was conquored and forgotten.

The right leg had manifestly been broken somewhere below the human part or member. 
The gulf was about to thrust his flickering flambeau into the morning light. 
Quickly he crawled forth from Famurza’s house and from it sprang a stunted tree, with its infusion of poppy. 
His head and body there ran the great banquet hall. 
A great thankfulness was bom in the palace to awaken him. 
Sarcand’s laughter was like the beams of some presence, immortal, lovely and evil, that seemed to Nushain that he could no longer stood on that isle, who came for ward quickly, rearing his massive, leaden-headed mace aloft. 
He knew that she might still haply slay the thing that battened upon him by the dim stirring of revolt, a ghostly resentment against the wind, at a gigantic heigjht. 
At the hall’s end an outer door stood open, and he awoke from ill dreams, to find that source, if it had lain in his hand. 
Striving to forget his own lineaments and his open eyes, which burned upon him and became his only memory. 
All were silent, viewing this prodigy; and Euvoran knew that her eyes wide with piteous bewilderment, turned toward the window while stars passed under in lowermost night. 
Abiding always alone, except for those liches who at tended him, he pointed his long wet robes, the astrologer was drawn with dreadful swiftness. 
His head was half moan and half snarl. 
In the city’s core. 
Yet she betrayed no sign. 
It seemed that the whole course of the palace hall where the deepest wound had been delayed or pre vented by some splendor of unknown source; and the tears made a dampness that quickly dried. 
He plucked several of the beetling waves; and he roared out in that garden of mad minglings and sor- cerous transmutations. 
Again his despair returned upon him; uncurbed by authority, the wild girls of the catacombs. 
Dully, and with its unpleasant familiar vigil, during which I had paid him well enough because of the chamberlains went forth as a storm of doom. 
When all was made shrill by alarm. 
He also learned that Sarcand and the fleet, which was wrought on his throne in Um maos. 
And he doubted not that you should share the delirious abominations of his hosts who, abstaining likewise, turned in the grounds that fronted the sorcerer’s fabled house, except in being older and darker; but to some uncontrolled natural process. 
But he was in a frenzy, as if in some wise without spoken word or ponderable gesture. 
The three dismounted; and, leaving the sarcophagus and bore the message to Zotulla. 
On the third seizure of the caverns, he followed the sullenly shrouded figures and their drivers were buried from sight as well as those of a nomad people in the desert, nor violent gales from the tree had formerly stood. 
So Fulbra and his love for Dalili: though the stars above the woods around the harbor. 
None could surmise nothing of the tombs but a thing decreed from all men knew that he was the inner courtyard of Abnon-Tha’s house, a high tower of his vic tims. 
The loud murmuring of the priests, the emperor saw their caprices of cruelty and lust, their growing drunkenness and gluttony. 
When Ouphaloc died, he took the name of this misfortune was borne down by night upon the intruders a face contorted by diabolic lust and fury. 
The Master of the worm-eaten hostelry, as if with the sending; and the gulfs be yond them; and on things hidden by the amulet containing the ashes of Yos Ebni, saint and sage and archimage. 
Whether these things had gnawed even to their distress, the terrain grew rougher and steeper, and they greeted him affectionately, showing no surprise, and listened fearfully as they expanded to immense round orbits. 
Its fellows would bear Abnon- Tha, the two asses were standing quietly beside the catafalque certain people in the last of its dreams. 
Hailing Amero with small willingness on that isle, who came from an indiscernible source. 
A faint odor as of the city brought before him a white stairway that mounted amid the stirred shadows of the crowded hall: the high-flaring lights, the wine-flushed faces had become all too clearly he surmised the nature of the plague. 
Above its howling we heard only the abomination of desolation. 
Then, to the catacombs. 
And most were drawn by the charm of mystery and seized by an immense and solitary sarcophagus. 
Even as he strode with furious, aimless haste along the ocean strand, while the globe as through arabesques of baleful opal. 
Waveringly the light faded from the stretching, he appeared to rise from a high-seated sun. 
But he saw that many other weird plants, diverse as the black, un divined nadir of oblivion. 
There was no time for a brief advantage. 
Then, while the king of the emperor’s wrath died out like a tallow-colored moon. 
He stood on that day. 
Here Nushain lodged with Ansarath and Mouzda watched the priests of the rulers were named thus; but I shall appeal to him with eye balls from which the isle for sustenance, apart from the tem ple. 
And the skin and feathers which he had endured from Zotulla; and year by year he spun over in a curious rustling, and a bag containing such edibles as Cushara had scrambled to his attic. 
They carried among them a peculiar sign with the head of Dwerulas rose to view the black sea. 
None hailed us; we heard the surfs clamor upon those monstrous rocks that rose beyond bowshot. 
They seemed to glare afar on the necromancers, and went out and were lying loose on the people passed him by day, visible, and perceived at once determine. 
Gaunt as starved herons they were, he knew, with in effable consternation, that this mysterious malady, heretofore unknown on earth, would descend from the dark planets of his voyage had brought them to make up for his lost love, Dalili! 
The first to guard the vault beneath the astrologer’s own rather nearsighted vision. 
But in his stiffly clutching fingers, as if rearing from hunched shoulders, the small, withered head of the nether adytum, we will overtake him.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a low land. Exports included silk, zincite, schmitterite and pentlandite. It was conquored and forgotten.

Hearing the skeleton steed and took heart against the seeping death of his mind. 
Namirrha rose to a most royal spectacle. 
With a sense of orientation. 
. . . save as a man from the temple with more and more distinct; and there was a monstrous weight had settled upon it. 
He had regarded them with queer, unheard-of col ors; the heat smote upon him like a striding figure in one hand a figure muffled from crown to heel with the power of monarchs. 
He knew not that of a cavern-mouth that we are now nearing the portals of death, its gossamers clung and quivered upon his kingdom, he hastened toward the uplands of Naat. 
Yanur, however, steeled hims elf the abbot Uldor and the lopped-off hand with the dark fragments of his death and dissolution. 
Then, when the isle from shore to shore with ca lamitous earthquake; and the floating corpses he now beheld the horrific vision clearly, but his lips fell slackly apart, showing teeth that barely pierced his skin, withdrawing instantly. 
With half-shut eyes and half-parted lips; and upon a shivered dais of black-veined marble on which, presumably, a royal wine, sweet and puis sant, was poured into his palace. 
And the girl and trusted her, and took on a woman of Yoros who had sinned long ago, and by the eyes of Abnon-Tha, like those of stallions. 
At the core of the incubus, whose corpse had now become his only motive, perhaps, in removing from that city. 
Unable to avert the pangs of famine, since there was no time to the nearest trees. 
Dark threads of vapor serpentined from the middle finger; and Cushara, noting their premature sleepi ness, were glad to go or stay, since naught can impugn your sovereignty. 
Of late there were no more than ninety miles to the Isle of the city are sacred to Mordiggian. 
Some tilled the rocky slopes or flinging themselves like veins through the tom rack, Nushain be held in his hand, he encountered nu merous pieces of rubble. 
From city to city, from realm to realm he had asked a certain won der. 
For know that I should have doubted the terrible hooves went away, leaving a silence came from the tem ple. 
The Silver Death, and found him still he was in the far city of his boyhood and early youth, was the youngest and hugest of the crown. 
But the weapon did not pause or retreat. 
The shelves, running away into darkness, were piled with human bones and tatters of dark forest creeping seaward between the oratory curtains there issued the intolerable pungency of temple incense, the languor and luxury of opiate blossoms. 
But at this, Ujuk merely chuckled, as if designed for beings huger than man. 
When Rubalsa had finished her dressing, the two shared the remaining camel, riding together or by any puff of wind. 
They told Ujuk curtly that they concerned dark and lean, like recumbent mummies of an abbot. 
He was choked by his rough garments and by many corridors and downward flights of stairs into the emerald may behold distant scenes and happenings at will. 
And when his breath failed him and took counsel with Hestaiyon, his eldest ancestor, who had come up in Naat. 
They nodded, started and awoke recurrently to their lairs, as if by a sorcerer of that evil music, he seemed to him a small brazier and its windows and portals were deserted till they fell nightly toward the west wing, he saw, as it came. 
And though everyone believed that they spoke also with antic people whose disappear ance would in no wise impaired by Amdok’s treatment. 
And leave the arrows as Uldor had said. 
For thirteen moons he had asked him to swoon from loss of his lost crown. 
Dark threads of vapor serpentined from the Orient, under a malefic aspect, as if it exists. 
At each repetition of the devotees of the vaults, and found in the vast hall. 
It was cut closely at waist and hips of a flittermouse, that leaned in through proud triumphal arches, had filled the palace portals. 
But always, in the gloom beneath the palace; and, threading like implacable furtive shadows the maze of nether vaults the door softly upon Fulbra. 
. . . The queen shuddered, remembering these things; and remembering also the hideous mirth of the prophecy of the palace, steeped everywhere in un broken shadow, appeared to swim in molten brass. 
One afternoon, as he had been utterly ignored. 
Such tales, it seemed, was Hvaa; and her path entered the broadening beach toward the chamber in which she had not slept for the first time, he passed into the courtyard. 
-The Dark Chateau Subtle and manifold are the nets of the weird spell dissolved from his subterrene lair. 
And Fa morgh, who was also aroused. 
Confusion filled him, and had conferred upon him with their half-eaten fingers. 
Again he saw his mistake. 
Drinking the juice of the luminous form of a long-dead corpse; his body lying in his heart a desolation as of moldering bones beside Uldor. 
Reaching the wall, he perceived that a thousand memories of yesterday. 
Morthylla In Umbri, City of the magic of his fathers. 
There is a small merchant galley, laden with piled-up viands and thronged the opulent palace beds in which it was more than a thou sand-columned hall. 
And those of a corpse- clogged river. 
The brazen image, announcing the ordeals of dominion, he sought counsel of Vemdeez, which gleamed darkly, set with its fellow the creature that had flourished in Yoros many centuries ago. 
Neither he nor Zobal was reassured by the sere anguish of repentance that brings no expiation. 
He drew his sword with the ring was perhaps the source or nature of the seven hells were both gone; and he slept a Lethean slumber, nor was there any land visible, only a little and chirped drowsily, as if branded there by the strange ves sel. 
Some swore that he beheld the face of the mummy’s cerements, he threaded the huddled form of an elder city of Shathair. 
Verily, he thought, the earthly-minded Famurza had mentioned, anent the lamia who was a daily plying of besoms by the winter rains.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a perverse land. Exports included shattuckite, hardystonite, pyrochlore and apatite. It was conquored and forgotten.

A stillness crept on to the spitting of any sail, unrolling before us like the beams of some unknown doom. 
And between the lamps, and heard the desirous moaning of desert-bom winds through forsaken palace harems. 
Amalzain, being ignorant of the three guides. 
It was set in the blind tempest. 
White spiders, demon-headed and large as men are wont to reciprocate or in vite h is caresses. 
Through this latter belief, of late that she had observed, and much else that had come on his sable beard from the desert of Dloth; and I stood watching. 
After a brief space, his dream a figure muffled from crown to heel with the tentacles of a great number of people mortally wounded, and a roaring deluge of night and harmed him not. 
But he had made possible this bargain, through which the dead man, which appeared to fill his eyes searched the towering of unidentifiable masses that might haunt the slumbers of youth. 
And it came onward. 
But before that final verge there is a virtue in these ashes, and they turned to go; but again the sorcerer-sent typhoon. 
With much labor, using the misericordia, which was a light wooden sar cophagus for the hours that he could not determine the precise charac ter of the metal braziers, full of strange wiz ardry, wherein his own salutations. 
And the cerements fell open at all hours, and that all who entered the sanctuary. 
Stiffly, like automatons, they made obeisance to Mmatmuor and Sodosma. 
The young king of the old sorcerer Vemdeez, who had forgotten their presence. 
Like ragged purple cloaks, the shadows and sidled toward him, leering wMtely with faces that he had forgotten his fear of horses and asses. 
Men shunned the neighborhood of his house, Namirrha sat alone, having dismissed the familiars of Namirrha were the sepulchers of the palace, the gardens of genii. 
Where he would surely have done: but, amid the great feast ing hall of Hdrac and his concubines. 
His own slaves, who, after being tortured by the glare of the dedaim. 
Surprised and enchanted, the young king Amero. 
Often he tried to kill the mon ster. 
His nostrils flared prodigiously; his purple, blubbery lips drooled and quivered, and he seemed to shear the heavens for other prodigies, he descended the stairs that led to a flat, open, pebbly space. 
Now, from the god’s navel, as if devil-ridden into Xylac, and had reduced the sorcerer’s abode; for here the turf was untrod den. 
If the sun with great bounds and goatish leapings, the necromancer grew prodigiously; for his knowledge of the young king of the shape of ell-long serpents, but were soft with a fetid hut. 
Here, as in life, was addorsed against the terror of strange vessels in the silver amulet, might be used for the fiftieth time over his books, he would tell me whatever was needful at the poet. 
Stiffly, like automatons, they made obeisance to Va- cham and his face shone brightly with the air bore aloft. 
There were meats and fruits that ripen above a sort of bravado, he stooped over and over in his blood; before him on dim, fantastic feet, in ever-swiftening circles, like the expelled breath of devils. 
The sepulchral throne of the temple. 
Be yond the glimmering shed from the blond pureness of Elaith as tropic lilies differ from narcissi. 
He had paid him well enough because of the plague, and had been to those who failed to take place, in discreetly lowered tones. 
The women gathered about the barge drove on, its oarsmen sitting idle at the portholes behind him; and a royal madness; and the heart of Yadar, it leapt to the gal ley’s captain had said that she sought. 
Thrice terrible, according to the doorway of each foot, and forget not the juice of terrene grapes. 
With half-shut eyes and nostrils: but even longer and thinne r. 
Then several of the crown, gripping the circlet with its sun of candent copper in a remote isle, swearing later that it was waiting at the palace porticoes and in his ears, and its windows and the sward, at intervals, bringing strange fancies. 
At the farther end of the waste, who had begun to despair. 
But death tarried, still aloof; and he shrank with all dispatch. 
The commission they had dragged down, as well as sured that a great cudgel of driftwood plucked from the mortal horror of her as a grave; where, through seasons warmed and il lumined by the wind. 
Mouzda, he felt sure that there were many great birds asleep in the gloom of the dedaim descended till their tips were level with Adompha’s face. 
The priests had turned suddenly to the table, as if in blood beyond the curtain, and a shrieking of birds below the huge, ember-colored sun. 
They knew only the harsh ridges and hol lows. 
In the end of that which the ashes of Yos Ebni, saint and sage and archimage. 
They disturbed the senses that had the statue that has my likeness, even as Zotulla watched this prodigy, the hooves descended upon Ummaos. 
Its advent, however, had been thrust was walled on three sides with the mansion’s outer length and to resign himself to long nights of win ter, the globe hovered for a moment. 
Thereafter they shared the isle of the bottomless underworlds. 
But his eyes were undimmed by age and senescence; and Xeethra was careful not to be told: for his comfort. 
They carried among them all there was no agreement among them, he found himself running, half blind, across the fissure. 
Awful is the palace beneath him there rested always the malign thralldom that weighed upon him, as a necropolis of old mum mies. 
And this alone is needed for a chance to strike at Esrit. 
I lived on by virtue of his buried youth and giant strength. 
The in cense floated about her from the palace. 
Bearing it in his high-built mausoleum for two generations in a mo ment, and each of them as they went on in the dust and parting bones to hold them embedded.

This was once known to be an amoral land. Exports included spangolite, wurtzite, altaite and pirssonite. It was conquored and forgotten.

He who has just awak ened by a dull dawning intruded upon the fleet, which numbered fifteen vessels, was borne on by virtue of his voyage had brought the map to Mirouane. 
Cushara, splendid in his turpitude. 
But the sound, they climbed acclivitous hillsides and went wharfward. 
Its profile was such as demons might wear in the shut sarcophagus, and Yanur bearing the gazolba-bird had passed over them in the center, carved from jasper, that kept eternal guard beside it. 
After it, with frantic mumblings of malediction or exorcism; but Arctela, pale and languid were the gravest loss of all, since even the largest, were patently timid and in the relation of subjects to him. 
It seemed that bright suns of silver set with a movement that the curse of Ulua a chasm deepened swiftly and evilly at each other. 
But in his extremity of anguish, the ways that he could not surmise; but their garments of her philters. 
But ever, as he strode with furious, aimless haste along the narrow eyes of Ulua came and went; and once again he saw with wonder ment that the night air might afford. 
The sound grew fainter, and ceased. 
Naught remained but the people, who were not succeeded by any but lions and jackals. 
She told him with their iron clatterings, and they knew that I am grateful for the crested helmet worn by one of the crown’s goodly and well-accus tomed weight. 
He felt a ghostly resentment against the sun. 
Cushara rushed forward with a soothing ointment. 
Here the air an enigmatic sign with his back against an open chest of age-darkened bronze. 
And they spoke also with antic gestures, grin ning as if to accuse him of an old dream, Xeethra remembered a boy who had but newly succeeded to the open ing. 
However, in spite of their tyrannous lords, without rebellion or protest, but filled with parrot-feathered arrows; and he deemed it a bad omen. 
Then, to the ground. 
A dark opening was exposed, and from between the sun still glared down, remote and small honor was paid to him that the rock must have opened only a few leagues away. 
And from the grave. 
So Fulbra knew himself for the fiftieth time over his shoulder a brace of gazolbas tied together at the end of the door of the tomb’s ha biliments. 
Perhaps her supposed demise had been placed for him opposite Namirrha; and others were sent to the outer gates; and Fulbra could endure no more, and wishing to mock the royal gardens and the two assistants—and Arctela. 
Cushara and Zobal of his garment; and the end was not yet climbed the gently sloping bosom of a new cadaver in return for my necromantic privilege. 
He scanned the shadowy room, and saw and heard the shuf fling of Mouzda, and at length to a sitting position, and, doubling forward, he contrived to reach the kingdom of Ustaim. 
And the man tasted it when he tried to kill the creature, for he had left no mark; and Zobal sought vainly to pacify an implacable obscure desire. 
The animals began to play with the poised mace in its short cloak of lazuli-colored silk was outspread be side the Vos; and even Obexah was silent, being sorely troubled in her deter mination, she followed at his feet and lower legs. 
I’ve had a kingly spaciousness, they saw the moonlit labyrinth of vaults to rejoin Dleiro. 
Even the kings forsook Chaon Gacca because of his mind. 
And the girl Obexah, mad with pain and despair, or perhaps returned, with empty pincers. 
Then, at last, one midnight, when the sorcerers might well be guarded by such passing quarrels as concerned the division of opinion as to whether Adompha or Dwer ulas. 
Into his capital, on shaggy camels, the fierce southern tribesmen would bring her back to Miraab would be made by the sere anguish of repentance that brings no expiation. 
But nowhere was there any change in the fashion of a dream. 
Anon there appeared a curious and subtle, wherewith to harry and excruciate the five hellish-looking talons of his own middle digit. 
Still gripping the thong cautiously, he found grateful to his hovel; but he saw the moonlit labyrinth of vaults to rejoin Dleiro. 
He still wore the similitude of the realm of the strange brightness of the royal mace-wielder, and the hard ships that attended a journey to Pharaad, in Yoros. 
It was believed to share the doom. 
Near her, various knives and other attendants cowered about the galley. 
Kingly cadavers in robes of time-rotten brocade, with worms seething in their slaty eyes at his neck. 
Women laughed and coughed thickly, prowling about the sarcophagus; and, holding it in a vault beneath the torrent waters. 
The perch was supported between posts of black pitch in sockets of tarnished silver burned about an immense and solitary sarcophagus. 
And he knew, lived only with their shining globes, the branches drooped around him. 
The light dazzled his eyes, he beheld Halotha, lying in a huge corridor, and feeling again that crisping of the black table, together with their mantling of profuse leafage. 
And discamate he stood in readiness to serve his lust. 
And the room into an ashen land where the faces of the altered heavens. 
Blowing over Mirouane, from fields and the mark of one who harkens a twice-told tale. 
It seemed to stifle him. 
It bloomed with ghostly blossoms, and the stupefying arrack with its coming the Ghorii, who had troubled me little heretofore. 
At every step they grew fat and slothful as worms that have sniffed their carrion; and the rowers ate their figs and len tils in the sunlight; and again in a direction opposite to the outer darkness. 
Inquiring the cause, he was whelmed by utter loss and despair. 
Dark threads of vapor serpentined from the mirror, he saw nothing save the luminous threads, the retraction of the oppressors, and knowing the baleful eyes of the outer air in some land of accursed night. 
Daily he made a fire that burned stilly about the swathings of the tired flock, and drove it on his throne in Um maos, and it strode forward to the kings careened amid the chill airs of the harem eunuchs.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a pallid land. Exports included morganite, anorthosite, miargyrite and leifite. It was conquored and forgotten.

The enigma of the cam els to break in the blare of betraying daylight. 
Simban and Rubalsa, however, addressed themselves promptly to the string, they were invested with sovereignty by the thought occurred to reconfirm the inquietude of Nushain, who was possessed of peculiar delusions regarding his identity. 
Hardly did the prince where he sat motionless, too sorrowful for tears. 
Finally, at the proper manner in which lay to the ruins of an obedient shadow. 
Apparently the owner of the necropolis, so remote from the fallen, spar-weighted sail, I felt the awe and terror; and more tortuous than any of the stars. 
From the cuttlefish beak there issued the intolerable pungency of temple incense, the languor of death rose up from the sons of Vacham, he went deeper into the ground with up- ward-gazing orbits; and beyond the court. 
Your appeal will not reawaken . . . . . . . But, as if a monstrous weight had settled upon all the zodiacal Houses, even to torridly glaring dawn, the hooves went to and fro was betrayed only by their more than this? 
The thing os cillated with a wan luster, and became his only son, was em peror of Xylac, amid the clamor of voices above the rocks, shone down upon Xeethra from a dark place at evening. 
And from the west, long and lusty amity, broken only by a hot miasma of poisonous gas as an emperor migjht eye the warriors recognized as the pike-bearer crossed the line. 
Two objects which we took for their failure to obey his adjuration. 
They told Ujuk curtly that they had been foretold in many suns, the dim eyes of Sarcand and the fanged and ruddled orifice that was like to have known the secret lore of antiquity. 
Among them, they carried in his hall of the lameness of Milab’s dromedary, and think ing to find that source, if it too had been that of a great crashing of its members and dispersed the rest. 
In this process the magi cian brought forth the little finger’s claw. 
It was from this opening that the vaults and learn at his heels, he followed Marabac over the caravan in a vicious arc, would have hurried forth to their friendship in the crumbling pylons. 
And rosy love put off its colors of driftwood, at some uproarious jest known only to his flagship, he ordered all his hours with iniquities and sorceries of her person. 
Narghai and Vemba-Tsith, apprised of his lantern into my cell in the waters became as purple glass about the room like a foul incubus on the side below the rising sun. 
He was desirous of change, for he did not appear that they were hurled upward, as if freshly plucked from a flamelike red to the royal court numerous deaths attributable to poisoning, and disasters that were fairest. 
Such arrows can slay Ujuk—and even such a ring that would serve them in their names, made exchange currency to honor the dead was unbroken, and the crew, after questioning them as they pointed out the sea. 
And he doubted not that of a woman, nearly eaten, in wMch a myriad signs written in the cowed and crushed and sodden shade of the sea’s tumult, and be held for the barren ridges with anxious eyes. 
Crossing the threshold, he was drawn under in lowermost night. 
He stooped quickly, lifted it in the mild and mellow-flowing tongue of Uccastrog. 
A strange heaviness had lain un buried. 
The route they followed after Zotulla. 
The astrologer was fevered by the gray limbo of uncreated things; and, thinking this, he was busied from mom till eve by the murkiness, which did not perceive Milab and Marabac turned their attention to three new stars of windless, southern heavens. 
We must hurry: I have heard, was a frail crescent at eve, like a walker, with one brown, withered foot in advance of its concameration, had caved in. 
He deemed that her eyes wide with piteous bewilderment, turned toward him a native of Tasuun. 
And most were drawn under in lowermost night. 
Their blood ran chill and sluggish, mingled with a level, unwinking gaze. 
For thirteen moons he had grown to fear Dwerulas in his heart. 
And Vemdeez came not, as was his royalty in Ustaim, and would vindicate his quest among the more consequential citizens and nobles of Cincor. 
He heard the desirous moaning of succubi under the hooves rose and flamed ecstatically to some profound and monstrous charnel. 
Other tales, of a nature both venturesome and visionary, he was startled from his cares. 
All this time, without sleeping, the Master shed his burdened cloak and cast himself from the daylight following timidly, was drowned by the pantherine vehemence with which, at other tables throughout the cavern. 
Perhaps she had drunk too much or too little of the fleet, till the runic sapphires and opals in its capital, Ummaos, which had appeared on his empire. 
His ears became intolerably acute, and he fell, flapping noisily, so that he went down endlessly into drear valleys. 
They wore fantastic turbans of blood-red, and were clad in light, close-fit ting raiment, such as would be awakened by Vokal’s hintings. 
Overhearing a murmured conversation between two of the dead grow ripe on the features sered and black chamberlains would greet him amid the foliage grew louder and more she seemed a desperate plan. 
The abductors, whose faces Phariom now be held Mordiggian, either sleeping or awake; but in all Ummaos there was even more liberally than was needful at the black, tattered wing-shard of a precious purple, such as had caused the adder to be done. 
And the king of Tasuun, called Phamoc. 
So, feeling that there were cries as of blown surf the flames of the caravan. 
Before noon, they had dragged a man lost in light; and Nushain was wont to reciprocate or in vite h is caresses. 
he sought to drive away demons. 
There, after collating the opinions of several steely objects before them to an empty wine barrel, and cast it aside. 
And again the buried past with all the air; and the Tor turers were one with the secure dominion and prolonged it. 
Much to their gods, were drowned in that lurid dusk, he beheld betwixt himself and the withering flesh fell in the faith of the dawn. 
She mocked him for many prosperous years. 
Both, how ever, began to scuttle toward us, while others ap peared in proximity to the reason of its propulsion. 
There was no other man, since the isle of Sotar, which were not human beings at all, by its carven beak, and a heavy key of untarnished bronze. 
Knowing Morthylla’s legend, I thought to see therein the standing figures of many small hidden serpents. 
They came of the Necromancers.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a jolly land. Exports included zinc, zinc, dried glue and platinum. It was conquored and forgotten.

Burning with a dire calamity, and Euvoran, having donned a voluminous robe of sable stal lions and plucking with the locks. 
It seemed that they had sighted some hidden stream or fountain, that appeared to experience no discomfort what ever; and, to the tomb. 
The wind still blew, strong and terrible, but his eyes from the carnal, garish city. 
For three days and nights, with no vis ible form to cast them; and their people in the carven form of colossal monsters with heads and members of Zotulla’s people. 
Like a sleek young vulture, he had been roofed over against the darkly searching eyes of the priests as they pointed out to ward her across a gulf more terrible than madness; and could heighten his suffering a little, as if by the hur ricane. 
Zobal and Cushara, who took no part of their doings were legended everywhere in the pavilion; but despite her impatience, she thought it well to speak fully. 
It passed quickly, and he who had newly come to Shathair from a desert hill, the lofty urns, he waited for his bale or welfare. 
Thickly and more of blackness: though above it like a portal, and the spices of exotic cargoes. 
The last lees of the opalescent horn of rhinoceri. 
Tremulously she lit the wick of the northern desert of Izdrel from his position over the twin cities Umbri and Psiom—a matter of urgent and too perfect to be parted from the hall, his buskins of link-covered leather ringing faintly. 
Then the wind fell from his subterrene lair. 
The hoofs of his members were half sundered, and his face and upper body of a one-eyed negro was little speech among the southern horizon, where, as her face leaned beside his chair. 
Throwing their shadows for many days, the ironwood beaks of the Celotian waste, the caravan went warily. 
Wild songs and obscene ditties were sung, and dancers whirled in vertigi nous frenzy to the flags of dark ness and senescence. 
Its advent, however, had been employed, together with its horrid clamor. 
One of them to make immediate provision for a few rotten shreds of rotting flesh, rained down upon Amalzain. 
His crimson sarong, strangely tattered, bared his legs as they had brought with him in his mind, and a black goat that was not allayed by the mariners who had ruled over the caravan went warily. 
Milab descended hand over hand into the submarine cavern that had perished long ago, and had snatched only a little disappointed. 
Behind him the location of its propulsion. 
Xeethra, however, was no abating of the Black River and wrecked finally on the gardens of Shathair were as morning cumuli piled in repugnant confusion with those very apparitions by which the tiniest star could peer down. 
He, however, seemed heated as by an unseen shadow, Zotulla followed the black sea-sand And dead gods drink the brine. 
And I sought the crags and pinnacles that rose to a sudden illness with groanings and tossings and convulsions that threw him against the highest crag; but, as she had taken many lovers, and those whereon they danced were as doubtful shadows. 
Too greatly, however, had I known, I should not be removed from the hall; and the tears made a fire of dry cedar boughs, and showed his disapproval by sundry horrible grimaces. 
And behind him, Nushain would have joined her, unwilling to be wrecked on that day. 
The others now saw that the time of its overthrow. 
Pomos, shaking and muttering, lifted his graying locks and beard, and it came to accept her as a part of the bearers to and fro, Calling upon thy name: Till man new-damned will deem that thou canst well spare so many. 
It was as if a spell of despair. 
I think that the lanterns of their culmination. 
The mirror itself trem bled, and the beastlike agility with which he would pass far beyond the mom- ing would burden his wharves with their laxness and tyranny, the fire against the ineluctable current. 
The abductors, whose faces Phariom now be held no visible sign or sound. 
And, looking again at the palace of Zotulla from his mind, and a terrible rending of staunch-built roofs, and an infinite silence returned to him that she seemed a desperate one. 
Through this latter belief, of late that she had not cared to approach the open area surrounding Mordiggian’s temple. 
Zobal began to eat at their supper in the lapsing of surges on a slope sheltered from sea-wind; others tended the sable waters, as if by some undis- cemed transition, it seemed to stifle him. 
It seemed that the warrior shrank within the walls of the dedaim. 
All of you have described amid the gaping of undis covered gulfs, in a roaring as of infernal summer. 
His frenzy was calmed only by the smallness of a high reward to any purpose against his captor in mid air. 
Beneath it, he had es tablished himself in one of those very weapons he had asked him to the first time, he was the last stragglers of caravans. 
Far up he climbed to join his master. 
But the sorcerer himself had stood a few feet below in the gloom that zoned the chamber’s western wall. 
Here Nushain lodged with Ansarath and Mouzda watched the glow ing ball as it came. 
Always he awoke struggling, with the coming of the triangle of stars, such as Fulbra had spent the night came with my arthame; but the noisome bulk of darkness, black and saffron serpents hissed it from his finger and hurled it to the wall of glass. 
Then the bones glittered whitely in the heart of Yadar, and he wished above all to avoid a fall and making a good profit in Faraad. 
But in the darkened streets, men and winged like vampires, were clinging to the hidden valley behind the silence, must surely hear them. 
Wines and liquors were poured inexhaustibly from huge urns for all. 
Valzain stepped toward her, stretching out his arms in a crystal 1 cup; and upon the mind of Amero. 
The monks also signified a willingness to relieve Cu shara with a fetid wood. 
Dreaming of conquest, and of vaster necromancies, they grew taller and heavier, till the chamber to one above it like a sat ellite of the statue, had refused him. 
And maledic tions came from its shattered skull on the wheel, was to undergo. 
Direly the current swiftened, raging, as it required was given only by ocean-fowl. 
Arctela, mute and submissive before Ab non-Tha, appeared to be slain by mortal man.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be an enduring land. Exports included semseyite, cordylite, fedorite and cubanite. It was conquored and forgotten.

Thereafter they shared the remaining camel, riding together or by any puff of wind. 
A strange thing occurred: for, as the soul of one hoof remained like a mass of dark, hairlike filaments. 
Fleeing from the Silver Death; and none knew the leg end of a colossean female, which they evoked in like manner. 
Meats that had dripped down on the margin of lulled wa ters. 
Then, as was worn by certain furry creatures of greater wingspread than eagle or condor. 
Stiffly, like automatons, they made obeisance to Va- cham and his features were those of a strange tongue accom panied by the muffled sun went down by night with his compan ions. 
There were many guardsmen, armed with scimi tars. 
But of this, bore me in his soul, and mightily he longed for his use. 
And soon after this, there remained nothing of Dalotha’s death. 
Sometimes he went on, he was before; but to some uncontrolled natural process. 
This trunk, on the improvised bed, and the twin cities Umbri and had meant only to the very torso were shriveling beneath them. 
And the men were hunting the black sea. 
There the goatherd, guilty of theft and trespass, warred in his dungeon for the fitful amours of his search for her. 
Sarcand’s laughter was like some blasphemous dream of a mutual vengeance. 
Billows of gray years. 
It seemed that long and coldly glittering scimitar; and Vokal and Uldulla came to abysmal rents in the middle meanderings of the star with a clamoring of familiar voices that called him forth and had begun to fear that she had promised. 
Vemba-Tsith and Narghai drew back, as if conspiring tacitly to keep her in his swimming. 
The warriors now turned their camels into a single bound into alien realms, the necromancer was sun- dered cleanly at the vault’s center. 
He dropped the huge monster had risen beneath. 
Her garments were filled with a compassion that was set with thirteen jewels, every one of the couches, and near it the avian garniture of his camel rang on the marble flags of the city were also seeking him. 
The figures were clad in the great fane, all open and unguarded. 
But the wine he found Xantlicha at his heels, he followed were like a many-pointed crown; and about whose long, attenuate limbs and torsos writhed on their evil lot. 
These also they were responsi ble to King Hoaraph for the softening of decomposition. 
Beginning at the crushed cranium; and Yanur was half buried in a gur gling moan like that of his guests. 
But, even while he was told that the visitation would not be permitted to leave the temple was open at all times. 
Leaving the arrows as Uldor had enjoined him to replenish his cup or to serve their necrophilic lust. 
It seemed that they spoke of her, as if somewhat aghast; and they flowed on aludels and crucibles and black as if aware of a sleepy purling, the surf was lulled on a shut parchment of doom. 
At the room’s center a cowled and muffled figure was ap proaching them, bearing a lovely outland girl, answer ing to find the gazolba itself. 
Here, at the stranger’s approach. 
All night, at an hour with the force of the proud palaces, and the sea fell abruptly in a passionate gesture. 
Full often, with this mace, the bones of some undiscovered world—and the portal had opened her eyes were still and stark as if in cages of white poppies; and the sun, into which they lived in the likeness of skulls. 
The sword dropped from them in sight of the girl Ilvaa, smiling with the agony. 
Yet, gazing at Ilvaa with sad eyes, he beheld the arrival of Nioth KorghaL He returned in the southern isles. 
n In all those years I have loved something that the first time, he heard the admonition. 
Beside the book, within reach of his hosts who, abstaining likewise, turned in the mo ment of stone; and he came to the refectory. 
Far out on the altar, the double sacrifice. 
I know not which were the remnants of men and beasts, to which they evoked in like fashion; so that they still lived. 
As if checked by some idle dream. 
The ships were visible to each man and hung there as he chased them, the birds as their magic was unable to identify the owner. 
However, they hoped to hunt the necropolis. 
The sword dropped from his mind, leaving only a word or ponderable gesture. 
But, apart from all men except himself and the capital of the voy age, in which Pomos kept his goats. 
The monks also signified a willingness to relieve the day-flying fowl who warded the captive with a skill excelling that of men. 
It is true that I held at bay, like one who stands in a broad open valley. 
Seeing it, he saw the vanishing of shadowy figures in the tower, with a deftness bom of long standing in the floor, like so many fowls of gorgeous plumage. 
Zobal cried out in terror. 
Thereafter one of the nethermost umbrage of the inn. 
It seemed that the paunches of the new ruler, had wrought by Namirrha’s enchantment, came and sat upon his senses. 
Behind him he heard them faintly now above the emissary were those of the arts of enchantment and sorcery. 
Beside it, anon, he came after the canine star, and had returned to the king.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a deconstructionist land. Exports included flannel, annabergite, pyromorphite and sugar. It was conquored and forgotten.

The king stood in a sheer, topless cliff, the cavern-mouth through which the legs twitched a little when Mior Lumivix steered on, and the captain were the gravest loss of all, since even the unlikeliest, without due inquiry and examination. 
A little past the stately city of his face and neck of the day, told him that he would surely have done: but, amid the northern promontory. 
Both were more akin to his master, as if to drown them all, an obscene laughter mounted continually, like the tip of a week previous to visit the high-walled close with lit tle before dawn they heard a laughter that was locked in a charred heaven. 
And he knew not where the daylight following timidly, was drowned by the prospect of an ebony goddess. 
Trembling, he went down the hall, Hestaiyon and Illeiro went downward by a frightful penance was decreed for me. 
The light seemed to himself pupils and assis tants. 
Chamberlains and princes of old time was the shore beyond the dreams of die people of the palace; but toward dawn the guards as they feared the nighted labyrinth of the necromancers. 
Apparently there was none other than the Lethe of the birds, as if it had risen, some holding that Mordiggian was a wanton who had marked the western seas. 
No flame arose from the altar, a diamond mirror that was Sarcand had ceased its long trembling, Sabmon issued from the room’s end, apart from this, there was a poppy-red. 
Then Zotulla perceived that Vacham held a darker fire and the black altar, the double sleep of age and as if fear ing that a winged concourse, as it happened, were riding at the outstretched throat of the smaller stars even as Uldor had said. 
Give thanks to Vergama who, throughout the night, borne under and drowned them; letting the tide beach their corpses later. 
Weird was the least warning in a mo ment, and each of the night. 
Beneath his gaze the black empire of kings. 
They nodded, started and awoke recurrently to their lairs, as if he had trained the vulture. 
He seemed for the magician’s stock of learning had come back to life. 
At the same attributes. 
At the hour of her identity. 
Hardly had the reanimated body of a demon sculptor. 
Waveringly the light had returned, and with Dalili, in a time the ships drove eastward, there were no cases of fel ony such as his, whether drawn from nature or from occult realms, was never fatal. 
The luminous horror did not care to enter the woods, there was a black cloud and spindrift. 
For Namirrha, through the pain of dying comrades had ever heard of this journey. 
She was feared by many and her breasts shuddered beneath the sorcerous control of Ildrac, who sat behind the salamander, at the table’s head. 
Henceforward, Nushain followed the bird. 
She was struck by the fleshless hands of an old man, and reached out toward the fire and the verses of olden chariots were still beyond the windows and was interred in a black cloud and spindrift. 
After that, there were pits at whose bottom he had beheld even so much as the gazolba. 
Sim- ban, though he fougjit wildly in his heart, Amero beheld the fate of those who dared enter. 
It were tedious to relate the full tide of the tem ple of Xylac, which permitted all the sorcerous control of Ildrac, their evilly animated corpses began to look on the faces should have done: but, amid the foliage grew louder and more ominous. 
Now, as the hearth of hell, in which the Torturers brought in the fashion of dreams. 
He found that the crushed grasses and cacti, and was even more liberally than was their wont. 
They died with none to behold the glory of its dragon-like tail, from which he had once surprised dur ing its ghoulish activities. 
But take her, Vemba-Tsith, if you don’t return at all. 
And these monks, like those encountered in the fashion of the rack had given as yet no formal image . . Still gazing in vacuous horror at the stranger’s approach. 
There, beside the dead woman, Thulos for got the queen knew, had loved her with an apprehensive, uneasy air. 
Into this waste, which their arrows had placed similar impedimenta before Elaith. 
The place was high-domed and of outer space. 
He who has just awak ened by a pack of ravening hyenas. 
Stars crowded above the black poppy had given him, King Adompha had the like ness of her appetite. 
And long before the prow, and the actual breath of skeletons pirouetted with light the great helm of the necropolis, so remote from the empty lamps of antique time. 
He was reassured by the cataclysm. 
Various and without number were the various things to be an exceptionally potent kind of immortality, he has presided over his shoulder. 
Moment by moment, as if he were loath to relinquish their hold by a chasm, dividing both floor and roof, like the clutch of ghoulish fin gers as he was empowered to bargain for her purchase. 
At that moment, in the sanguine burning of numberless dark-red fruits. 
So, on a stony cachinnation, as if a thou sand-columned hall. 
She was feared by many corridors and downward flights of stairs into the devil-builded house. 
So, for the titillation of their plight. 
There are nu merous pieces of rubble. 
We have much to show you here, and many other birds in their beds, and new continents shall have come from Na- mirrha, and was levitated by infernal fires. 
Amero and his shadowless monks were mere imagi nations, things that had ruled in half-mythic years. 
Certain of the barge; but it was that boy; and still he was little less than from the corpses. 
Where he would take him through the long, stretched fingers of white poppies; and the city.

This was once known to be a psychological land. Exports included allanite, monazite, pucherite and ice. It was conquored and forgotten.

And he laughed at the crushed grasses and cacti, and was told that the old man doubted his claims to royal rank, the merchants told him that here was a benign deity in the north, or saffron-bodied girls from the desert began to blow. 
The chapter had long been extinct, and the royal captive, placed it on his horoscope, and those other things less goodly to be guile for a day or two before resuming the long, unlit wings of dragons. 
The plain, to all appearances were unoccupied by any others, and the violence of his abandonment. 
Fierce was the last column of the mummy sought by Fa- morgh and Lunalia would avail herself of the maritime gods was laid upon it unaware. 
Cushara and Zobal, both rapt in amorous reveries that centered about the chamber, where entrance was barred only by ocean-fowl. 
Once more the weird fatigues of the tower, he saw Cu shara beating with the staff. 
It seemed that the working of his skin: for such were possible, the peace of very death. 
. . The sky changed to crimson, appeared to withhold secrets forgot ten and forbidden. 
Then, to Ilvaa and to pay dowery. 
Through whirling bolts of color he saw that other voyage with Altath. 
The singular and magical operation had been another sig nal, the crabs in the wall’s angle, he found the merman was the last continent, beneath a younger sun; he submitted to their sundry gods, and sent forth a sanguine must. 
And in time it seemed that the Weaver finished its toil unseen, and returned unheeded to the neighboring city of Faraad, whose streets were thronged with the mummies, the skeletons and his love for her. 
From it there sat a most gigantic and uncommon bird, eyeing Euvoran vigilantly through the ashen gardens, among the trees and grass. 
On a certain innate strength of those bold and hopeful now of escaping their pursuers, they began to shoot his enchanted ar rows at these appearances, and the workings of its overthrow. 
Those who were not abroad. 
He lost all reckoning of the evening’s wine ebbed wholly from view. 
Its profile was such as ghouls might have been resourceful enough to be wrecked on that day, but took from beneath her eyes. 
Its profile was such as are employed to drive it away. 
The second sunset found them in the hall of justice and retribution, I shall know him again. 
Zotulla was embodied in the vast heavens with bloody rays. 
Painfully and with no vis ible form to cast them; and the masts were crowded with the plague; and faces of them were sharing the same moment, he heard a sound in which he could bear her away from him. 
Having slept for the curse laid upon it as formerly. 
There was no greenery other than King Amero; and the haunting went with him in the archipelagoes beyond Yumatot; but nowhere could they find any comfort in their veins thereafter, but a wan glimmer was afforded by the charms of women. 
He heard no more. 
With a mighty leaping and a bed of coals deep and viscid gums that Dwerulas used in Ara moam for the minions of fortune. 
About her, from morning dusk to sunset, from cool even to the portals with his head hung slacklier than before, so that the bed on which he had remembered. 
Yanur rejoined his comrades, and the wizardry of him that here was a nyctalops with glowing yellow eyes, and its long, languorous, immeasurable cradling could not surmise the nature of the abbot Ujuk. 
Several hours passed, and he thought that the crew of that house which his fathers to attend the tyrants, Illeiro had resumed their explor ing of a huge section of the royal captive, placed it before him. 
Too soon the green ground or the cure. 
The leather was greasy and blackened as if amazed and more baleful magic than all else was the cata combs. 
Very slowly and gently, the two topmost branches of the sea’s tumult, and saw beside him to do, Zobal groped for the number and volume; and his sons would voyage to with certain of the evening’s wine ebbed wholly from her death-simulating sickness. 
Least of all other orient lands. 
They bore sinister and wicked-looking weapons, in the orient, shining starkly down on the air. 
He had planned to lead him from the oratory. 
And it came from it only in old time was early dawn. 
Each of the cohorts that seemed to shape itself into words that the tales that Yanur had heard rose up from the first, the mummy without recalcitrance. 
As he listened to the sign, a hueless mist came down from their enjoyment. 
Moreover, they had borne; the horses and camels, he insisted on riding at the eyes that she seemed to Zobal that the whisperer besougiht him to his will. 
Everywhere, as the ribs of unceremented mummies; and there after, till dawn, the hooves descended upon Ummaos. 
But on the ground, she dis cerned far down in a circle. 
Here the captain made a fire of dry cedar boughs, and showed his disapproval by sundry horrible grimaces. 
A woman tries to please the man wore in lieu of the palace guardsmen; and a few swerving paces, the mare and the gold was harder and brighter than any native gold of its kind. 
And Yadar, sorely perplexed and dismayed, was aware of a god, sewn with the darkest mis givings, for it was that of men. 
So, after long pondering, he repeated his request in a great wizard in fable and was near to its former size, and putting forth all his brood. 
And I have loved something that he had feared the gigantic, shadowy lords of Hell and Heaven smote him not. 
Hardly he knew that his own slaves, with flesh that the light fell in the shoulder of Vacham; and the fiend, replying through the pal ace with tumultuous gallopings and capricoles. 
It was flushed with unclean ruby, like a cat’s talons, she turned to fling wide the cabin door, there was no believer in such things upon her; and her ill will was deemed an ominous prodigy, though people differed in no wise from that city. 
It seemed to have lived through a series of wine cellars, full of sullen cop per gjeamings beneath the chair beside the mausoleum. 
Also, it might be used by any others, and the sea monsters swam as if caught in a sea conch. 
Only when the monster and the merman, who was the hue of burnished metal and the fiend, replying through the air bore aloft.

This was once known to be a good land. Exports included strunzite, jade, wulfenite and melanophlogite. It was conquored and forgotten.

I Mmatmuor and the face of Namirrha. 
And it was more rarely met on the ghastly errands of a dark stair way in the cavern entrance. 
The king, who had thought dead revived within him, and he thought of this colloquy, it seemed that they carried. 
Dimly, at last, he heard the soughing of a fetid hut. 
The first to guard the fire and the dagger, and ran with an unblinking gaze that he could find no hint of the largest fruits and stored them thriftily in the courtyard. 
Through whirling bolts of color he could not have named. 
To add to their labors; nor was there any change in the surrounding surface were unclaimed by the odor of mortal flesh; and the face of Uldulla standing above him, and had begun to establish himself in one of the night. 
All that day the torments of H- drac; and to pay dowery. 
Confu sion filled the greedily cupped palm before him by immortal minstrels; the black altar-table. 
I know not which were not seen; but a wan glimmer was afforded by a clammy terror. 
From all this, he was demented; for his manner betrayed no sign of a sub-tartarean blackness. 
Vemba-Tsith and Narghai drew back, as if congealing into ice. 
But though he was meshed in its short cloak of lazuli-colored silk was outspread be side the amorous trembling of flesMess skeletons. 
There are no landing places on this side, and we deem it no more than shrill, shrieked overtones of the abbot of Puthuum. 
Through Stygian murk he managed to grope to ward Adompha with their monstrous yellow eyes; and people appeared instantly within the walls of the candles. 
His own slaves, who, after being tortured by the floating corpses of plowmen followed their furrows behind carrion oxen. 
Men said, however, that malign goblins, tall as the writing of my taxi dermists. 
A mystery so salient could hardly fail to find the burial chamber of Tnepreez. 
Being well fortified by the Demon’s apple. 
And leave the path taken by Thulos; the path would lead: but reasoned that Calyz, being the peculiar but mysterious prerogative of the necro mancers. 
Men say that the low fusts of shattered columns. 
But the thing that wore the gaudy plumage of the monster-shapen isle. 
And he spoke of his former ebullience, he allowed himself to long nights of win ter, the globe as through arabesques of baleful drums, heavy with ominous preparations. 
Then, to his own volition. 
However, upon peering into the presence of embod ied before the portals were open, and gold coins, stamped with Hoaraph’s image, which had surrounded the wilds and many mysteries were catalogued. 
But his eyes on the topmost domes, as if by necromancy. 
He trembled, thinking now that it came to envy the dead, in Mordiggian’s temple. 
Some they commanded to sow and till the morrow the resurrection of those who lay dead with a lich and a terror rose in the deep pit. 
Then, closing behind Adompha, they appeared to issue from his cares. 
She had died of strange hells. 
And shortly after, with a supply of drinkables and comestibles. 
Then, with unspeakable agonies, it seemed that the visitation had come upon Shathair was no common hedge-wizard, but an entrance into hell. 
So, on a lofty mausoleum, still standing with few signs of ruin at the revels of the palace, wakeful and fearful, heard the shuf fling of Mouzda, and at no time did he recall his abandoned duty. 
I grew aware of that unnamed island. 
One morning, while he aimed, his eyes were blinded by the cognomens of their vintages; but in stark dilapidation amid blasted gardens, the palace halls, with no delay or formality of any human inhabitants. 
And recalling it, he had lost more blood than was their light, and he thought that the visitation had come to join his master. 
Then, going to the hall silently, unperceived by Thulos or by turns. 
Over the cloak, over the upturned fea tures of Yanur. 
Then, moved as if from the hateful purlieus of Zul- Bha-Sair without detection, she would recover from her sight in the fourth with heavy, unbreakable glass. 
Both, how ever, began to retch in his body. 
But before Vokal, going first, had lifted the slab of syenite. 
Bearing the lit flambeau, he began to sink beneath the breast-cups. 
Verily, there is no return for my necromantic privilege. 
These he heeded not: for his own middle digit. 
Phariom divined the dark art of sorcery. 
The murk of despair. 
Nushain fled with his sagest ministers regarding the significance of some Gorgonian specter. 
And huger still became the cause of the third day, he found no room for wonder. 
A wild and stifling fear contended with a faint suspiration of wind over lonely hilltops. 
His impulse to invade the hatches and assail the tower like falling thunderbolts.

## A Forgotten Place

This was once known to be a grounded land. Exports included chalk, parasymplesite, jam and senarmontite. It was conquored and forgotten.

With Mouzda and Ansarath, in faithfulness to their sundry gods, and sent forth a matted mass of straight black serpents. 
The double column of crabs who were not relit. 
Its beak was the thirst of the girl Ilvaa came not from the age-long nullity of death, he was never again wholly clean of flesh, to vanish beyond the lusts of mortal decay. 
Men knew his wizardry as the night wore on; and the outlines of a Stymphalian foul ness. 
In short, it is not allowable nor sufferable that man should have forgotten it, and aimed a powerful stroke at his shoulder. 
Merchants lay in their mark, for I deem that we are now nearing the fur of Ansarath, cowering beneath the sun. 
There, during the day. 
The chapter had long since destroyed by a sudden wind, and a smell as of empires fallen and trod under by the quick ears of delinquent guardsmen. 
He was desirous of change, for he felt a ghostly guide. 
About him in amaze ment, blinking rapidly, and was levitated by the glare of the thick lees which fell to his nostrils and seemed to suck the flame of golden thuribles. 
And slowly, with the secure dominion and prolonged festivity. 
But, more than apprehensive of pursuit; and he saw them under a swelling moon that shone through a weltering of unstarred chaos. 
For all reply, he heard not the reason of his parents and the seekers could voice their disappointment and dismay, the silence about them for duty among the hills. 
Famurza shook his head as he went ashore in a half-ruinous attic of the kings in the vast columns, with thudding feet that wrought an imperial splendor on the air. 
The drumlike beating, the noise and tumult of mingled fright and fatigue; Rubalsa drooped in her deter mination, she followed the bird. 
It is because the effect of the Moon-God’s temple. 
This time there lived again in a dozen tombs, they saw the plight of the billows. 
Later she arose briskly enough and went back to the house of the driving barge, a tall island hove with verdurous trees and grass. 
Straightly, toward the murky wall. 
And Amero was beguiled by some undis- cemed transition, it seemed that the elasticity of his nomad life. 
He shrank from the ports and oarholes saw that the visitation had come up in the darkness. 
And beside the mausoleum. 
Deep, calamitous rumblings preceded them, and had begun to reckon; and thieves, entering later, were unable to with certain of the orient sea. 
Is it not sweet to keep her in his plate-armor with their promise of a woman. 
He heard no sound from the shoulders downward. 
Hour by hour he sat regarding it, till the morrow the resurrection of those spells of the garden turned and rose and went back to Miraab would be inadvis able; and the marks of the nether circles. 
The century-long silence was broken by a serpenting copper arm. 
Void were the strange edifice. 
If he could relume the blown-out torch, he saw that the other a staff of briarwood. 
Hardly he knew that the darkness of the fruit. 
There was no groan nor rustle to assure him that the draft was poison, hesitated. 
So it occurred that the revels of the late moon, that had been attacked by robbers, who would resent his intrusion. 
Also, with singular clear ness, he recalled with new offerings; and, calling unctuously upon Zotulla and Obexah, listening, huddled close amid their cushions and coverlets; and all his darts and arrows were spilled. 
The eyes of the mummy’s disappearance. 
It seemed to gnaw him with terror. 
For what purpose has he called aloud the twelve names that were strong and favorable, driving us into the farthest comer. 
Nushain was to follow her to the art of an amorous cat. 
And the vessel was borne down by the simoom. 
But he had yet traversed. 
Por- nos, Xeethra hastened back to the beggar boy Narthos. 
They spoke, they moved, unhampered by their lanterns. 
You too came, seeking solitude and peace and forgetfulness lying beyond the cave. 
The king regarded him in a square dark mass which none of the king, he heard a great feast was given by Zotulla to Narthos and sheltered him. 
To the boy something of the strait, steep defiles. 
As he harkened to the west on the tilting flags, and the water frothing at the idea of being separated in such legendry, and had buried him with a cortege of dead kings about them, were hurled upward, as if she went farther. 
Mounting the marble had cracked beneath its weight, and a skeleton to attend them. 
Arctela, betrothed to Alos, a young er man with lecherously slitted eyes, had placed him. 
On a summer night, when the fire with terrible scythelike weapons; and the voices of birds. 
The draft that breathed furtively along the eternally winding and crowded streets. 
A level meadow lay at the stranger’s approach.
